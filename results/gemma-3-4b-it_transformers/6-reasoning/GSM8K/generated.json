If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?",
        "output": {
            "reasoning": "There are 5 total ounces of water because 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5\nThe total temperatures is >=200 because 200 / 5 =<<200/5=40>>40\nThe 33 degree water contributes 132 points towards this because 4 x 33 = <<4*33=132>>132\nThe unknown temperature is at least 68 because 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68",

        "generated_output": "```json\n{\"reasoning\": \"Let $x$ be the temperature of the second mug. Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water into his bottle and 1 ounce of $x$-degree water into his bottle. The total volume is $4+1=5$ ounces. The temperature of the mixture is such that Donny can drink it. This means the temperature must be at least 40 degrees. The amount of heat in the 4 ounces of 33-degree water is $4 \\times 33 = 132$ degree-ounces. The amount of heat in the 1 ounce of $x$-degree water is $1 \\times x = x$ degree-ounces. The total heat is $132 + x$ degree-ounces. The total volume is 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixture is $\\frac{132+x}{5}$. We want this temperature to be at least 40 degrees, so $\\frac{132+x}{5} \\ge 40$. Multiplying by 5, we get $132+x \\ge 200$. Subtracting 132, we get $x \\ge 200 - 132 = 68$. Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.\", \"answer\": 68}\n```"
