        "input": "Input text: The host Atlanta Hawks defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 107 - 100, at Philips Arena on Wednesday. Most of the statistics would indicate a Milwaukee win, but Atlanta prevailed thanks to great teamwork. The second quarter was especially decisive, as the Hawks outscored the Bucks 31 - 9 in that 12 - minute stretch. Strangely, Milwaukee took 26 more shots than Atlanta, but made only four more baskets. The Bucks also dominated in the paint, outscoring the Hawks 50 - 28. Atlanta was extremely efficient though, as they shot 49 percent from the field and assisted on 29 of their 35 made baskets. They also took care of business at the charity stripe, going 27 - of - 31 from the free - throw line. Milwaukee (5 - 5) had their opportunities to win this game, but they realized how tough it is to beat an efficient Atlanta team. Giannis Antetokounmpo carried the load, as he tallied 26 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists. Jabari Parker was great as well, totaling 23 points, eight rebounds, three assists and three steals of his own. The only other starter in double figures was Tony Snell, who amassed 11 points, four rebounds and three assists. Mirza Teletovic was a nice spark off the bench, as he scored 14 points on 5 - of - 10 shooting. Milwaukee will be on back - to - back duties, as they travel to face the Miami Heat on Thursday for their next game. Atlanta (9 - 2) had to play this game without Dwight Howard (quad), but they did n't miss a beat. Paul Millsap stepped up in his absence, as he tallied 21 points, eight rebounds and three assists in the win. Mike Muscala started for Howard and provided 16 points, five rebounds and three assists of his own. Kyle Korver had one of his best games of the season, totaling 11 points, six rebounds and five assists. All five starters for Atlanta scored at least 11 points and provided at least three rebounds and three assists. On deck for the Hawks is a road matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Friday.

This was the second match up in a week between the Bulls and Raptors. Chicago won the last game as well and have now won their last seven versus the Raptors. With this win the Bulls have also extended their current win streak to four. Toronto was up 103 - 91 with six minutes left in the game, it was from then on that the Bulls went on a 24 - 10 run to steal the road win. Jimmy Butler hit a huge three with the defense right in his face, which put the Bulls up by one with 30 seconds left. The Raptors were not able to hit a counter - punch, missing three straight shots, while Chicago faired well enough from the foul line in the last seconds to stay on top. Jimmy Butler led the Bulls with a monstrous 42 points on very solid 15 - 23 shooting from the field (2 - 3 3Pt, 10 - 11 FT). Butler also logged five assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block, in 38 minutes. Pau Gasol had a very strong performance, finishing with 19 points (7 - 16 FG, 5 - 6 FT), 13 rebounds, six assists and four blocked shots, in 33 minutes. Nikola Mirotic chipped in 17 points (4 - 9 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), three rebounds and one assist, in 28 minutes. The Bulls as a team shot very well, going 51 percent from the field, 88 percent from the foul - line and 42 percent from distance. Derrick Rose sat this one out with a sore hamstring, while Joakim Noah remained out with a shoulder injury. Toronto was led by guard - combo Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, who combined for 46 points on the game. Lowry finished with a full stat - line, including 22 points, 10 assists, five rebounds, one steal and one blocked shot, in 39 minutes. DeRozan led the Raptors in scoring with 24 points on 7 - 17 shooting from the field (3 - 6 3PT, 7 - 8 FT), in 35 minutes. Luis Scola was the third prong of the Raptors attack, as he finished with 22 points (9 - 17 FG, 2 - 2 3PT, 2 - 3 FT), along with five rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block, in 27 minutes. The Raptors will be right back in action on Monday as they begin a five - game road trip in Cleveland. This will be an important stretch for Toronto if they want to establish themselves at the top of the East. Meanwhile, the Bulls will be back in action on Tuesday, when they host Milwaukee.

        "input": "Input text: The Houston Rockets (26 - 11) cruised during Saturday's 97 - 82 victory against the Utah Jazz (13 - 25). Houston entered the contest with a previously - unknown quandary, but Dwight Howard brushed aside a minor knee injury to earn a game - high 37 minutes. While his double - double streak ended at four outings, he still managed to tally eight points, eight rebounds, one block, and one assist. The bulk of the offense came from a familiar source, James Harden, who recorded his 15th 30 - point game of the season to uphold his status as the NBA's leading scorer. By drilling four of the Rockets' 13 three - pointers, he's now hit multiple treys in five consecutive contests - - and 28 of 37 games this season - - en route to 27 points per outing. Even Donatas Motiejunas got in on the act, knocking down one trey, but more important was his third double - double of 2014 - 15 (14 points, 10 boards, and three steals in 36 minutes). On Monday, the Rockets return to the East Coast to take on the Brooklyn Nets, with an eye on extending their winning streak to four games. After Wednesday's impressive win in Chicago, the Jazz have suffered back - to - back defeats, and the primary culprit has been a combined 47 turnovers, including 27 on Saturday. On a positive note, the frontcourt welcomed back Enes Kanter following a four - game absence due to a sprained ankle, and the big man responded with 16 points, six rebounds, and one steal in only 21 minutes. The presence of Kanter did n't push Rudy Gobert back to the bench (yet). However, the Frenchman upheld his workload from Kanter's stay on the sideline, racking up four points, five boards, three assists, three blocks, and one steal in 35 minutes. By the final horn, the Jazz had shot merely 41 percent from the field, but no one contributed to the mark more than Gordon Hayward, who put up an ordinary nine points on 2 - for - 10 shooting. Upon returning to Utah, the Jazz will attempt to press the reset button in their next outing, Tuesday versus the Golden State Warriors. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has six columns and three rows. The column headers are \"Team,\" \"Percentage of field goals,\" \"Losses,\" \"Total points,\" \"Turnovers,\" and \"Wins.\" The row headers are \"Rockets,\" \"Jazz,\" and \"Player.\"   The second table has 14 columns and six rows. The column headers are \"Assists,\" \"Blocks,\" \"3-pointers made,\" \"Field goals attempted,\" \"Field goals made,\" \"Free throws made,\" \"Minutes played,\" \"Offensive rebounds,\" \"Personal fouls,\" \"Points,\" \"Total rebounds,\" \"Steals,\" and \"Enes Kanter.\" The row headers are \"Gordon Hayward,\" \"Rudy Gobert,\" \"Donatas Motiejunas,\" \"Dwight Howard,\" \"James Harden,\" and \"Player.\"",
