        "input": "george puckrin harrison, also known as `` shoey'' because he was a shoemaker by trade (11 february 1862 -- 14 september 1940) was an english cricketer who played fifty-nine first-class matches for yorkshire county cricket club between 1883 and 1892. he also appeared in first-class cricket for the players (1883), t emmett's xi (1883), lord sheffield's xi (1884), an england xi (1884) and l hall's yorkshire xi (1891). born in scarborough, yorkshire, england, harrison began his career on 3 may 1883 at lord's for colts of the north against colts of the south where as an unknown 21-year-old he obtained nine of eleven wickets -- all clean bowled -- for fourteen runs. harrison consequently came straight into a strong yorkshire eleven when he dismissed monkey hornby in the first innings, and bowled out lord harris for 2 in the second. harrison soon became regarded as the fastest bowler seen for some time in first-class cricket, and in only his third first-class match against kent he took eleven for 76 and bowled unchanged through both innings with ted peate. with the aid of a number of very fiery pitches in yorkshire and at old trafford, harrison took eighty-eight wickets for yorkshire at a total cost of only 1,049 runs. in the process harrison surpassed 1882's record-breaking wicket taker peate as yorkshire's most destructive bowler and became the first bowler to take 100 wickets during the season of his initial first-class appearance. much was naturally expected of harrison, but early in the 1884 season he suffered a bad arm injury when throwing from the deep field and suffered an amazing decline, taking only eighteen wickets in ten first-class matches. in 1885 harrison returned to the side at the end of june and achieved one good performance of five wickets for 38 against gloucestershire on a good wicket, but by 1886 it was clear that the strain of bowling at his former pace was damaging his arm. harrison played only twice for yorkshire that year, bowling eight wicketless four-ball overs, and moved to league cricket, bowling old lane c.c., and idle c.c. (where he took 215 wickets at 9.15 each over three seasons). harrison did briefly reappear against warwickshire (not then first-class) and cheshire in 1887, but broke down when showing promise of his early form (which would have been tremendously valuable in such a dry season as 1887). it was not until late 1890 that harrison, now adjusted to bowling at a much reduced pace, returned to first-class county cricket, doing so dramatically with ten for 100 against county champions surrey allowing yorkshire to win after following-on, and then ten for 109 against mcc. harrison bowled regularly for yorkshire in 1891 but his record was moderate, and lost his place to a young george herbert hirst (already a much better batsman even going in late) the following season. between 1892 and 1898, harrison returned to bowling old lane c.c., for whom from 1883 to 1898 he took 878 wickets at nine each, and then took up umpiring. he umpired in minor counties matches from 1904 to 1907 and was a regular first-class umpire from 1908 until his retirement at the end of the 1924 season.",

so he served a mission in england. he left in february 1885. some of the first elders he met were also from davis county, one of them being george osmond with whom he would later serve in the star valley stake presidency, and daniel h. wells. anson arrived back in utah in 1886 and found his family in good health but arresting of polygamists was still very common. because of this he has to escape to chesterfield, idaho where he lived with his uncle chester in hiding. many of his relatives lived in and around chesterfield, and emily came to teach music to them. it was there that anson heard about star valley, wyoming and its seclusion and the friendly attitude the governor had towards polygamists. alice and anson and their children set out with chester's brother, bowen, to try pioneering in star valley. they hauled logs and built two cabins; a one-room cabin for anson and a two-room cabin for bowen. there were at that time about ten families living in similar cabins in the afton town site. on november 16, 1887, uncle chester call arrived with bowen's wife, theresa, and daughter, theresa's mother pamela thompson, and anson's wife alice with her daughters maud and ella. they came in one light wagon with few supplies. as uncle chester drove up to the cabin, he said to alice, `` here is your mansion''. the cabin was small (14x16 feet) with a small cook stove, a wooden rocking chair, few cooking utensils, bedding, and dishes. boards were nailed into the wall for a bunk bed. winter supplies were piled in the corner, and the south end of the room was reserved for the carpenter's workbench and tools. anson made a turning lathe entirely of native wood, powered by a foot treadle. he made furniture to trade for meat, milk, hay, and buckskin. anson was offered a school teaching position for fifteen to twenty students but gave the job to bowen who had no other means of employment. anson's brother joe came with his families, and the following year they built the first framed buildings with shingle roofs. for several years anson and joe built many structures of importance in the valley. they were also partners in the first furniture store and machine company. anson taught school in the winter and built buildings in the summer. in 1892 he designed and supervised the building of the afton ward chapel. that same year the star valley stake of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints was organized with george osmond as president, william walton burton as first counselor, and anson vasco call ii as second counselor. in august 1904 the cornerstone was laid for a new tabernacle, and anson served as architect and builder. the tabernacle was dedicated in august 1909. he also built and sold many homes in the area. he built one for his first family on the corner of madison street and 3rd avenue, and he built a new home on fifth avenue for his fourth wife, margaret ann hepworth. on september 13, 1901 and mass meeting of afton citizens was held to select a committee to incorporate the town. anson vasco call ii, william henry kennington, and osborne low were selected. anson vasco call ii was elected the first mayor and began serving in 1902. in all, he served nine terms as mayor of afton (1902, 1903, 1904, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1924, 1925, and 1927). anson personally supervised the installation of the first city water system in 1913. he served for many years as the federal land bank appraiser for lincoln, uinta, and teton counties, and as the government weather observer. anson vasco call ii died thursday, october 12, 1944 in afton, wyoming. october 17, a large crowd of his family attended the funeral; twenty-nine of thirty-seven children were there. he was buried in the afton cemetery.",

        "input": "rosalind elsie franklin (25 july 192016 april 1958) was an english chemist and x-ray crystallographer who made contributions to the understanding of the fine molecular structures of dna (deoxyribonucleic acid), rna (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her dna work posthumously achieved profound impact as dna plays a central role in biology, as it carries the genetic information that is passed from parents to their offspring. born to a prominent british jewish family, franklin was educated at a private day school at norland place in west london, lindores school for young ladies in sussex, and st paul's girls' school. she excelled in all major subjects and sports. she passed her matriculation at age eighteen, and won the school leaving exhibition of # 30 a year for three years. her father asked her to donate the money she earned to refugee students during world war ii. then she studied the natural sciences tripos at newnham college, cambridge, from where she graduated in 1941. earning a research fellowship, she joined the university of cambridge physical chemistry laboratory under ronald george wreyford norrish, who disappointed her for his lack of enthusiasm. fortunately, the british coal utilisation research association (bcura) offered her a research position in 1942, and started her work on coals. this helped her earn a phd in 1945. she went to paris in 1947 as a `` chercheur'' (post-doctoral researcher) under jacques mering at the laboratoire central des services chimiques de l'etat, where she became an accomplished x-ray crystallographer. she became a research associate at king's college london, in 1951, but was compelled to move to birkbeck college only after two years, owing to disagreeable clashes with her director john randall and more so with her colleague maurice wilkins. at birkbeck, chair of physics department j. d. bernal offered her a separate research team. she died in 1958 at the age of 37 of ovarian cancer. franklin is best known for her work on the x-ray diffraction images of dna while at king's college, london, which led to the discovery of the dna double helix. franklin's x-ray diffraction images, which implied a helical structure for dna and enabled inferences concerning certain key details thereof, were shown to watson by wilkins. according to francis crick, her data and research were key in determining the structure and formulating crick and james watson's 1953 model regarding the structure of dna. watson confirmed this opinion in his own statement at the opening of the king's college london franklin -- wilkins building in 2000. her work was published third, in the series of three dna `` nature'' articles, led by the paper of watson and crick. watson, crick and wilkins shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1962. watson suggested that franklin would have ideally been awarded a nobel prize in chemistry, along with wilkins. after finishing her portion of the work on dna, with her own research team at birkbeck college, franklin led pioneering work on the molecular structures of viruses, including tobacco mosaic virus and the polio virus. continuing her research, her team member, and later her beneficiary aaron klug went on to win the nobel prize in chemistry in 1982.",
