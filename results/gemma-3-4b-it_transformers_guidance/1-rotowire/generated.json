        "input": "Input text: The host Atlanta Hawks defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 107 - 100, at Philips Arena on Wednesday. Most of the statistics would indicate a Milwaukee win, but Atlanta prevailed thanks to great teamwork. The second quarter was especially decisive, as the Hawks outscored the Bucks 31 - 9 in that 12 - minute stretch. Strangely, Milwaukee took 26 more shots than Atlanta, but made only four more baskets. The Bucks also dominated in the paint, outscoring the Hawks 50 - 28. Atlanta was extremely efficient though, as they shot 49 percent from the field and assisted on 29 of their 35 made baskets. They also took care of business at the charity stripe, going 27 - of - 31 from the free - throw line. Milwaukee (5 - 5) had their opportunities to win this game, but they realized how tough it is to beat an efficient Atlanta team. Giannis Antetokounmpo carried the load, as he tallied 26 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists. Jabari Parker was great as well, totaling 23 points, eight rebounds, three assists and three steals of his own. The only other starter in double figures was Tony Snell, who amassed 11 points, four rebounds and three assists. Mirza Teletovic was a nice spark off the bench, as he scored 14 points on 5 - of - 10 shooting. Milwaukee will be on back - to - back duties, as they travel to face the Miami Heat on Thursday for their next game. Atlanta (9 - 2) had to play this game without Dwight Howard (quad), but they did n't miss a beat. Paul Millsap stepped up in his absence, as he tallied 21 points, eight rebounds and three assists in the win. Mike Muscala started for Howard and provided 16 points, five rebounds and three assists of his own. Kyle Korver had one of his best games of the season, totaling 11 points, six rebounds and five assists. All five starters for Atlanta scored at least 11 points and provided at least three rebounds and three assists. On deck for the Hawks is a road matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on Friday.

This was the second match up in a week between the Bulls and Raptors. Chicago won the last game as well and have now won their last seven versus the Raptors. With this win the Bulls have also extended their current win streak to four. Toronto was up 103 - 91 with six minutes left in the game, it was from then on that the Bulls went on a 24 - 10 run to steal the road win. Jimmy Butler hit a huge three with the defense right in his face, which put the Bulls up by one with 30 seconds left. The Raptors were not able to hit a counter - punch, missing three straight shots, while Chicago faired well enough from the foul line in the last seconds to stay on top. Jimmy Butler led the Bulls with a monstrous 42 points on very solid 15 - 23 shooting from the field (2 - 3 3Pt, 10 - 11 FT). Butler also logged five assists, four rebounds, one steal and one block, in 38 minutes. Pau Gasol had a very strong performance, finishing with 19 points (7 - 16 FG, 5 - 6 FT), 13 rebounds, six assists and four blocked shots, in 33 minutes. Nikola Mirotic chipped in 17 points (4 - 9 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), three rebounds and one assist, in 28 minutes. The Bulls as a team shot very well, going 51 percent from the field, 88 percent from the foul - line and 42 percent from distance. Derrick Rose sat this one out with a sore hamstring, while Joakim Noah remained out with a shoulder injury. Toronto was led by guard - combo Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, who combined for 46 points on the game. Lowry finished with a full stat - line, including 22 points, 10 assists, five rebounds, one steal and one blocked shot, in 39 minutes. DeRozan led the Raptors in scoring with 24 points on 7 - 17 shooting from the field (3 - 6 3PT, 7 - 8 FT), in 35 minutes. Luis Scola was the third prong of the Raptors attack, as he finished with 22 points (9 - 17 FG, 2 - 2 3PT, 2 - 3 FT), along with five rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block, in 27 minutes. The Raptors will be right back in action on Monday as they begin a five - game road trip in Cleveland. This will be an important stretch for Toronto if they want to establish themselves at the top of the East. Meanwhile, the Bulls will be back in action on Tuesday, when they host Milwaukee.

        "input": "Input text: The Houston Rockets (26 - 11) cruised during Saturday's 97 - 82 victory against the Utah Jazz (13 - 25). Houston entered the contest with a previously - unknown quandary, but Dwight Howard brushed aside a minor knee injury to earn a game - high 37 minutes. While his double - double streak ended at four outings, he still managed to tally eight points, eight rebounds, one block, and one assist. The bulk of the offense came from a familiar source, James Harden, who recorded his 15th 30 - point game of the season to uphold his status as the NBA's leading scorer. By drilling four of the Rockets' 13 three - pointers, he's now hit multiple treys in five consecutive contests - - and 28 of 37 games this season - - en route to 27 points per outing. Even Donatas Motiejunas got in on the act, knocking down one trey, but more important was his third double - double of 2014 - 15 (14 points, 10 boards, and three steals in 36 minutes). On Monday, the Rockets return to the East Coast to take on the Brooklyn Nets, with an eye on extending their winning streak to four games. After Wednesday's impressive win in Chicago, the Jazz have suffered back - to - back defeats, and the primary culprit has been a combined 47 turnovers, including 27 on Saturday. On a positive note, the frontcourt welcomed back Enes Kanter following a four - game absence due to a sprained ankle, and the big man responded with 16 points, six rebounds, and one steal in only 21 minutes. The presence of Kanter did n't push Rudy Gobert back to the bench (yet). However, the Frenchman upheld his workload from Kanter's stay on the sideline, racking up four points, five boards, three assists, three blocks, and one steal in 35 minutes. By the final horn, the Jazz had shot merely 41 percent from the field, but no one contributed to the mark more than Gordon Hayward, who put up an ordinary nine points on 2 - for - 10 shooting. Upon returning to Utah, the Jazz will attempt to press the reset button in their next outing, Tuesday versus the Golden State Warriors. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has six columns and three rows. The column headers are \"Team,\" \"Percentage of field goals,\" \"Losses,\" \"Total points,\" \"Turnovers,\" and \"Wins.\" The row headers are \"Rockets,\" \"Jazz,\" and \"Player.\"   The second table has 14 columns and six rows.

        "input": "Input text: The San Antonio Spurs (29 - 17) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (22 - 22) 101 - 95 on Sunday at the AT & T Center in San Antonio. Despite a strong first half where the Bucks out - scored the Spurs 55 - 47, they were n't able to hold off the reigning NBA champion Spurs in the secondf, suffering a tough six - point loss on the road. While the Bucks shot better from field and the three - point line, they were dominated at the free throw line where the Spurs went 26 - for - 30 and the Bucks finished just 9 - for - 13. The Bucks also committed 21 turnovers, which may have been another big difference in this game. The Spurs had a strong showing from their frontcourt, as forwards Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard were the team - leaders in both points and rebounds. In 31 minutes, Duncan finished with 20 points (9 - 13 FG, 2 - 2 FT) and 11 rebounds, while Leonard had 19 points (4 - 11 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 10 - 12 FT) and 14 rebounds in 36 minutes. It was Leonard's third double - double in his last four games, recording at least 14 rebounds in each of those matchups. Tony Parker really struggled with his shot for the Spurs (3 - 13 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), but still contributed 10 points and five assists. He's now averaging 15 points and 5 assists on the season. The Spurs did find some production off their bench, with two players finishing in double figures in points. Boris Diaw had 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt) and three rebounds, while Manu Ginobili finished with 13 points (3 - 8 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 6 - 8 FT) and three assists. Despite the loss, Kris Middleton played well, going 9 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to finish with 21 points and five rebounds as a starter at shooting guard. He's had two strong showings in a row, combining for 37 points, 12 rebounds and four steals over that span. Jerryd Bayless played very well off the bench for the Bucks. In 22 minutes, he added 15 points (5 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 7 FT) and five assists, as he was very efficient with his time on the court. Bayless had n't scored in double figures since the beginning of January, so it was good to see him turn things around on the offensive side of the ball and play well against a tough Spurs team. Zaza Puchulia added 12 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 2 FT) and six rebounds in 24 minutes, while Ersan Ilyasova finished with 11 points (4 - 8 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 4 FT) and six rebounds in just over 22 minutes. The Spurs' next game will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday, while the Bucks will travel to Miami to play the Heat on Tuesday. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has 4 columns (Spurs, Losses, Total points, Wins) and 2 rows (Team, <NEWLINE>)   The second table has 13 columns (Assists, 3-pointers attempted, 3-pointers made, Field goals attempted, Field goals made, Free throws attempted, Free throws made, Minutes played, Offensive rebounds, Points, Total rebounds, <NEWLINE>, Player) and 9 rows (Ersan Ilyasova, Zaza Pachulia, Khris Middleton, Jerryd Bayless, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Boris Diaw)",

Marc Gasol continued his stellar season, showing off his spectacular passing ability from the center position. He finished with 15 points, six rebounds, three blocks and eight assists. He has averaged five assists over his past five games, while shooting 91 percent from the free throw line during that stretch, which is n't an easy feat for one of the game's few true centers. The Grizzlies are now 11 - 1 over their last 12 games, and only have one game against an opponent with a record better than .500 before the All-Star break. Isaiah Thomas led the Suns in scoring, putting up 24 points to give Phoenix a spark off the bench. Eric Bledsoe turned in a good game with 21 points, seven rebounds, eight assists, four steals and two blocks. He hit two free throws to give the Suns a 98 - 91 lead with 3:31 remaining in the game. Memphis' Zach Randolph went on to score five points in the final 2:33 to give his team a fighting chance. Jeff Green then hit a bucket, was fouled in the process with four seconds left, and went on to make the free throw to give the Grizzlies a lead and a 102 - 101 victory.

In a battle of the two worst teams in the NBA, the less worse team prevailed. Philly's first win of the season came against the Lakers and it was evident Los Angeles wanted to return the favor in their home building. They played some of the best defense they've played all season, as they allowed just 84 points on 37 percent shooting. They also dominated the turnover battle, as the Sixers committed 16 turnovers while the Lakers committed just 10. Both teams shot under 38 percent from the field and they shot a combined 9 - for - 40 from long distance for an atrocious 23 percent. The Sixers have been a revived team recently, but couldn\u2019t muster up much here. The worst offense in the NBA showed it's true colors tonight and couldn\u2019t get anything going. The only player who played well was Nerlens Noel, who tallied 15 points, 12 rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks in the loss. T.J. McConnell also had a solid game off the bench, as he amassed 12 points, seven assists and four rebounds. Jahlil Okafor came off the bench here once again and it may be time to re - insert him into the starting - five, considering he is the best offensive player on this team. The Sixers will have a tough task on Saturday, as they'll have to play the Los Angeles Clippers in the second half of a back - to - back set. The Lakers played this game without Kobe Bryant and it was one of their best games of the season. The bench brought in some great energy, as all four players grabbed at least three rebounds and combined for an impressive 10 steals. Lou Williams was the star of the night though, as he contributed 24 points, five assists and four rebounds in the win. Larry Nance Jr. also had a nice game, as he set a career - high with 14 rebounds in the victory. This isn\u2019t a great win by any means, but it's definitely something for them to build off of going forward. The Lakers will take on the Phoenix suns on Sunday in their next game.

The Celtics dropped their second straight game to Western Conference opponent\u2019s in the back and forth affair that featured two of the craftier coaches in the NBA. Terry Stotts\u2019 group got the better of Brad Stevens\u2019 currently fourth seeded team. Boston was able to get their shots off terrific creation in the first half and entered the third quarter with a slim four point lead, but C.J. McCollum and Al-Farouq Aminu were all but unstoppable down the stretch to give the Blazers the edge. Aminu made up for a brutal shooting night from Damian Lillard, who simply could not get into a rhythm at any point, or break away from the defensive swarm sent his way. Lillard finished with 14 points on 3 - of - 16 shooting, and did the majority of his damage from the free throw line. Aminu bailed out the all - star point guard with one of his best performances of the season, as he finished with 28 points, nine rebounds, one assist and a steal on 11 - of - 19 shooting in 36 minutes. Gerald Henderson and Allen Crabbe were efficient off the bench and aided the starters with a combined 26 points and nine rebounds. While the Celtics have success against the Eastern Conference, they fail to impress against the talent that the Western Conference throws their way, granted they just got Jae Crowder (ankle) back from an eight game absence. The integral part Crowder plays on both ends of the floor will give Boston a boost heading into the playoffs, as proven by his 13 points, 10 boards and two assists. It might take some time for Crowder to find his three point shot again, but when he does it will only make the Celtics better. Avery Bradley and Isiah Thomas sliced and diced through the Portland defense in the first half, and came out of the contest with a combined 42 points and 10 rebounds. The west coast trip continues for the Celtics, as they face up against the league\u2019s best Golden State Warriors (68 - 7) at Oracle Arena on Friday, while the Blazers welcome Dwyane Wade and the Miami Heat (43 - 31) on Saturday.

The Sixers (12 - 25) have seemingly been allergic to winning streaks for the last few seasons, but Joel Embiid and an improving roster are quickly proving to be immune to the frailties of years past. Friday, Embiid spearheaded his team's first three - game winning streak in three seasons by leading all scorers with 24 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, an assist, three blocks and two steals. The third - year big man got to the foul line an impressive 14 times, parlaying 12 of those visits into points.

The Clippers are the far superior team and they showed why in this win. In fact, they led for the entirety of the second half, leading by 20 points at times in their victory. Los Angeles was lights - out from the field, shooting 51 percent from the field, 42 percent from three - point range and 88 percent from the free - three line. Turnovers really killed the Pelicans, as they committed 14, while forcing just nine from the Clippers. The Los Angeles starters controlled the game, outscoring the New Orleans starters, 77 - 48. The Clippers (16 - 5) were playing the second half of a back - to - back, but that did n't appear to slow them down a bit. Blake Griffin was the player of the game, as he accumulated 27 points, 10 rebounds and four assists in the win. Chris Paul flirted with a triple - double, amassing 17 points, eight rebounds and 13 assists. DeAndre Jordan scored just six points, but grabbed 13 rebounds and recorded two blocks. Jamal Crawford dropped 21 important points off the bench as well. On deck for Los Angeles is a home matchup against the Indiana Pacers on Sunday. The Pelicans (7 - 13) have been much better recently, but this was a tough task against an elite Clippers team. Anthony Davis was the only starter in double figures, as he tallied 21 points, six rebounds and four assists. E'Twaun Moore was second on the team, scoring 15 points off the bench. Tim Frazier accrued eight points and eight assists as the starting point guard. Terrence Jones had a nice game off the bench, totaling 12 points and nine rebounds.

After a very tight first half, the Rockets managed to jump out to a nine - point lead heading into the fourth quarter. But the Hornets responded to even the score, though they were unable to contain James Harden. After scoring just 18 points in Saturday's win, Harden turned in a vintage performance with 36 points (9 - 16 FG, 2 - 7 3Pt, 16 - 19 FT) to go along with seven assists and five rebounds. It was the third straight win for the Rockets, who are over the .500 mark on the season for the first time since Nov. 7. Harden did n't get much help from the rest of the Rockets' starters, but he did get some support from the bench. Terrence Jones posted 17 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting from the field and Marcus Thornton put up 13 with a pair of 3 - pointers. Dwight Howard was relatively quiet after recording back - to - back double - doubles. Houston will get a chance to extend its win streak to four games Wednesday against the Magic. The Hornets - - for the most part - - played a pretty tight defensive game, but had no one to slow down Harden, which was the difference in the end. They also experienced one of their worst offensive games of the season, shooting just under 35 percent from the field while hitting just 12 - of - 41 attempts from beyond the arc. Charlotte tried to spread the ball around with seven players taking eight or more shot attempts, but it did n't translate into winning basketball. The Hornets will look to end their mini two - game skid Wednesday against the Celtics at home. Table format: There are two tables in the text.

        "input": "Input text: The Boston Celtics (14 - 10) beat the rising Charlotte Hornets (14 - 9) after the teams traded three - pointers in the final 30 seconds. For Boston, the win came on the coattails of a devestating loss in double overtime against the Golden State Warriors. Despite the extended matchup on Friday, the Celtics came out guns blazing in Charlotte. Rising star Avery Bradley led the way with 23 points, while point guard Isaiah Thomas had a 21 - point, 13 - assist double - double. Boston has exceeded most expert's expectations this season, now sitting four games above .500 and coming off a back - to - back in which they defeated the Eastern Conference's second seed and came seconds away from snapping the Golden State Warriors' historic win streak. The young team, along with third - year coach Brad Stevens will hope to improve upon last year's surprising playoff run. Meanwhile, the loss comes as a bit of a momentum killer for Charlotte, who had won five of their previous six games. Even in the face of a loss, small forward Nicolas Batum put up strong numbers. In his first year with the Hornets, Batum has been impeccable, putting up impressive averages of 17 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists and helping the lottery team transform into one of the Eastern Conference's toughest matchups. Point guard Kemba Walker, meanwhile, had an off shooting night, going just 5 - 15 from the floor. After what was a heartbreaking Friday night for Boston, the win against Charlotte should help the team regain its momentum before a big game against Cleveland on Tuesday. Charlotte's next matchup will be against the Magic in Orlando on Wednesday. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has 4 columns and 3 rows.

        "input": "Input text: The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 121 - 109, at Spectrum Center on Saturday. The Cavs (25 - 7) entered the contest down one of their Big Three, as Kyrie Irving's hamstring strain proved too much to play on. That left a larger load than usual on the capable shoulders of LeBron James and Kevin Love, and as customary, both All-Stars were up to the challenge. However, Kemba Walker was in no mood to let the Hornets (19 - 15) back down from the reigning NBA champs on Charlotte's home court, and went off for a game - high 37 points. He supplemented his scoring haul with five rebounds and five assists over 35 minutes, and went 13 - of - 22 from the field overall. Despite his remarkable effort and the fact that the Hornets managed a 51 percent success rate from the field, the visitors still proved to be a bit too much to handle, as they drained their buckets at an equally impressive 51 percent clip, including 45 percent from three - point range. James' 32 points led Cleveland, and he added nine assists, six boards and a steal. Love provided a 28 - point, 10 - rebound double - double, while Jordan McRae, drawing the start in Irving's stead, totaled 20 points, four rebounds and an assist while putting on a shooting clinic. The second - year guard was 8 - of - 12 from the floor, including 3 - of - 4 from three - point range. Tristan Thompson supplied 11 points, six rebounds and a steal and Kay Felder, another young backcourt player getting extended opportunity due to Irving's injury, led the second unit with 13 points. Frank Kaminsky III was actually second in scoring behind Walker on the Hornets, as he registered 15 points and five rebounds. Nicolas Batum compiled 13 points, eight assists, six rebounds and a pair of blocks in another stat - sheet - stuffing outing. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist amassed 12 points, eight rebounds and a block, while Marvin Williams managed 10 points, four rebounds, an assist, two blocks and a steal. The Cavs return home to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday evening, while the Hornets visit the Chicago Bulls on Monday night as well. Table format: There are two tables in the text.

Indiana is now 20 versus Minnesota this season. This game was very tight for three quarters, going back and forth with 13 lead changes. Indiana grabbed the lead 73 - 70 with 10 minutes to go in the fourth and that would be the last lead change of the game, as they outscored the Timberwolves by 16 in the fourth quarter. Monta Ellis led the Pacers in scoring, with 22 points (8 - 15 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT), along with six rebounds and three assists. Ellis also gave up six turnovers in his 36 minutes on the floor. Paul George finished with 18 points (7 - 16 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt), four rebounds, three assists and one steal. George turned the ball over five times himself, contributing heavily along with Ellis to their teams ugly 23 turnovers. To make up for it, the Pacers shot a hot 50 percent from the field and 92 percent from the foul line.

In a battle between two teams looking to vie for the eight - seed in the west, Minnesota prevailed with a big win. They took care of busines from start to finish, as the T'Wolves led for over 45 minutes of this game. Defense carried Minnesota, as they held Dallas to 42 percent from the field and 24 percent from three - point range. The Timberwolves also dominated down low, winning the rebounding battle, 44 - 35 and the points in the paint differential, 48 - 30. The Mavericks (22 - 35) have struggled on offense all season and duds like this against a bad Minnesota defense only adds to those troubles. Seth Curry had the game of his life though, dropping a career - high 31 points on 13 - of - 17 shooting. Harrison Barnes was the only other Maverick in double figures, as he totaled 20 points, six rebounds and two steals. Dirk Nowitzki accumulated eight points, seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. The Timberwolves (23 - 35) continue to battle for a playoff berth and wins like this over teams who are ahead of them are imperative for that pursuit. Andrew Wiggins led Minnesota in scoring, as he amassed 27 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Karl-Anthony Towns was the most valuable player, as he collected 26 points and 18 rebounds on 12 - of - 18 shooting. Ricky Rubio finished third on the team, totaling 13 points, five rebounds, 14 assists and three steals. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has four columns and six rows.

Atlanta really struggled in the middle quarters, scoring just 25 combined points in the second and third quarters. Rebounding was key for Utah, as they won that battle, 55 - 40. The Jazz held the dynamic Atlanta starters to just 37 points on 14 - of - 51 shooting. Atlanta (8 - 6) is in a bit of a slump right now and they'll hope this blowout loss is rock - bottom. Dennis Schroder led the team in scoring, as he recorded 16 points and three steals on an inefficient 6 - of - 19 shooting. Paul Millsap was the only other starter with more than four points, as he tallied 11 points and five rebounds on 5 - of - 11 shooting. Thabo Sefolosha led the bench, dropping 11 points and seven rebounds. Atlanta will look to play better on Sunday in a road matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers. Utah (9 - 8) have the number - one defense headed into this matchup and they showed why in this blowout win. Gordon Hayward led the Jazz in scoring, totaling 24 points and seven rebounds. George Hill was one point shy of Hayward, as he finished with 23 points and five rebounds of his own. Rudy Gobert took just two shots, but finished with a 10 - point, 10 - rebound, five - block double - double. Trey Lyles also recorded a double - double, amassing 13 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. Utah will be off until Monday, when they play the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road.

        "input": "Input text: The Cleveland Cavaliers (1 - 1) defeated the Golden State Warriors (1 - 1), 95 - 93, in overtime Sunday at the Oracle Arena to take Game 2 of the NBA Finals. With Kyrie Irving's knee injury to sideline him for the remainder of the Finals, few people gave Cleveland a chance to win a game, let alone a game on the road. LeBron James did everything he could to give the Cavaliers the victory in Game 2, however, and now the series is tied at one game apiece. James finished with 39 points, 16 rebounds, and 11 assists over 50 minutes on the floor to notch his fifth career triple - double in the Finals. Despite James' dominance, the Warriors still had a shot to win the game in overtime. Stephen Curry, who struggled from the floor throughout Sunday's contest, missed the potential go - ahead jumper with seven seconds remaining in overtime. This game will be one to forget for the MVP, who finished 5 - for - 23 from the floor and 2 - for - 15 from beyond the arc. Sunday's game marked the first time in NBA history that the first two games of the Finals went to overtime. Game 3 will take place Tuesday in Cleveland at the Quicken Loans Arena. Cleveland had questions surrounding its supporting cast behind James, but its role players stepped up in a major way Sunday. Matthew Dellavedova, who was filling in at point guard for the injured Irving, was a difference maker on the defensive end and scored all nine of his points in the fourth quarter and overtime. He also made crucial plays on loose balls and rebounds all night, giving the Cavaliers extra possessions. The Cavaliers nearly let this game slip away due to questionable fouls by J.R Smith that let the Warriors cut into their deficit. Cleveland will need to minimize those miscues in Game 3, but for now, it's happy to be going back to its home court with the series tied. Golden State was dragged into a slower paced game Sunday which forced it away from its strengths. In addition to Curry's struggles from the floor, no bench player managed more than seven points in Game 2 and the Warriors shot just 40% from the flooor and 23% from beyond the arc. There were some positive takeaways from the Warriors on Sunday, namely Draymond Green's defense and Klay Thompson's 34 points. The Warriors will need Curry to bounce back in Game 3 on Tuesday in order to regain the series lead. Table format: <NEWLINE>  There are two tables.  The first table has 7 columns and 2 rows.

With the game tied at 95 - 95, Tobias Harris was able to hit a jumper to put the Magic up by two. Steph Curry had something to say about it though, as he drained a three - pointer for the go ahead bucket with under 10 seconds left, thus giving the Warriors a share of the Western Conference lead and victory number 10 on their current win streak. The \"Splash Bros\" did it again for the Warriors, as Curry and Klay Thompson led the team in scoring. Curry went 8 - for - 17 from the floor and 3 - for - 9 from the three - point line to scored 22 points, while adding five assists. Thompson shot 8 - for - 16 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from beyond the arc to post 20 points of his own, while also adding five assists. They continue to be one of the most dangerous duos in the NBA. Harrison Barnes chipped in his second double - double of the season, as he contributed 14 points and 12 rebounds. He's now averaging 11 points and 6 rebounds on the year. The other two Warriors to reach double figures were Draymond Green, who had 11 points and seven rebounds, and Marreese Speights, who had 12 points off the bench. The Magic got most of their production from guard Victor Oladipo. He shot extremely well, going 10 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from behind the arc to score 27 points. It was a season - high in points for him. Center Kyle O'Quinn had his best game of the year as well, despite playing in only five up until this point. He scored 21 points (9 - 16 FG) and had 11 rebounds, giving him his first double - double of the season. Tobias Harris was able to hit a clutch jumper near the end of the game, but was trumped by Curry, who hit the game winner. Harris had a solid outing though, going 6 - for - 14 from the field and 5 - for - 5 from the free throw line to score 17 points. He also had seven rebounds and five assists. The only other Magic player to reach double figures was Evan Fournier, who scored 10 points. The Warriors' next game will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday, while the Magic will travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Wednesday.

The Celtics were expected to win this game easily against a shorthanded Knicks team, but they were dominated in this shocking result. The rebounding was the glaring difference, with New York winning that battle, 57 - 33. The bench production was a major part of that, with the Knicks bench outrebounding the Celtics bench, 35 - 8. Shooting was also decisive, with the Knicks shooting 51 percent from the field, while the Celtics failed to crack 39 percent shooting. The Knicks (19 - 24) had to play this game without Kristaps Porzingis and Joakim Noah, but prevailed with an impressive road win. Derrick Rose had a vintage performance, tallying 30 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. Willy Hernangomez was huge off the bench, providing 17 points and 11 rebounds. Courtney Lee collected nine points, eight rebounds and seven assists off the bench as well. Mindaugas Kuzminskas got the start for Porzingis and accrued 17 points and six rebounds. New York will play again on Thursday against the Washington Wizards. The Celtics (26 - 16) had won 13 of 16 games headed into this matchup, but this was simply a game where they did n't have it. Isaiah Thomas kept Boston hanging around, as he dropped a game - high 39 points, while adding three rebounds and two assists. Al Horford did hand out 10 assists and grab seven boards, but he scored just five points on 2 - of - 14 from the field. Jae Crowder was second on the team, dropping 21 points and five rebounds. Boston will be off until Saturday when they host the Portland Trail Blazers for their next game. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has six columns and two rows.

The Warriors came into this game as a monster favorite and they left very little doubt in who the better team was. Not only did they win all four quarters, they never relinquished the lead after the first quarter. Golden State were lights - out shooting, as they went 49 - of - 78 from the field and 14 - of - 21 from three - point range. Ball movement was key, as the Warriors assisted on 38 of their 49 made baskets. Many statistics were lopsided, as Golden State dominated the paint scoring, fastbreak points and points off turnovers. Phoenix (6 - 14) came in with a league - worst defense and they left feeling even more discouraged. Eric Bledsoe did continue his great run though, as he tallied 27 points, five rebounds, four assists and five steals in the defeat. Devin Booker was second on the team, scoring 21 points and dishing out five assists. No player on the team had more than five assists and no player reached double figures in rebounding. Brandon Knight led the bench in scoring, dropping 14 points in 22 minutes. Phoenix's next game is on Tuesday, when they play the Utah Jazz on the road. Golden State (17 - 3) were expected to win by 17 and they nearly doubled that spread with unstoppable offense. Stephen Curry led the team in scoring, dropping 31 points on 10 - of - 15 shooting. Klay Thompson had one of his best games of the season as well, accumulating 26 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals in the blowout win. Kevin Durant was n't far behind, tallying 20 points, four rebounds and eight assists. The bench combined for 45 points, as they were used for the majority of the fourth quarter. Golden State will play again on Monday, as they host the Indiana Pacers for their next game. Table format: <NEWLINE>  There are two tables.

There was an NBA record tied in this game, as there were 88 combined three - point attempts. There were eight ties and 16 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than 14 points. Cleveland actually dominated the shooting, as they outshot Houston from the field, from three - point range and from the free - throw line. Rebounding was the glaring difference for the Rockets, as they won that differential, 52 - 38. Houston were also playing great defense, recording 10 steals to Cleveland's three. The Cavaliers (43 - 22) have now lost five of their last seven games, as they continue to struggle on defense. LeBron James led the way for Cleveland, as he accumulated 30 points, seven rebounds and five assists, despite committing eight turnovers. Kyrie Irving accrued 28 points, three rebounds, eight assists and two blocks. Richard Jefferson was the only other player in double figures, as he dropped 16 points on a perfect 6 - of - 6 shooting. On deck for the Cavaliers is a home matchup against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday. The Rockets (46 - 21) continue to take their three - point shooting barrage through the NBA and a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers shows just how much they have improved. James Harden recorded his 16th triple - double of the season, as he collected 38 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Ryan Anderson finished second on the team, totaling 16 points and six rebounds. Nene Hilario came off the bench to provide 12 points, six rebounds and three steals, while Eric Gordon led the bench with 13 points.

Giannis Antetokounmpo notched his fifth triple - double of the season as he led Milwaukee to its 23rd win at home. The Bucks got out to a quick start, leading by as many as 14 in the first quarter, before the Magic fought back to make it a one - point game by halftime. The Magic came out of the locker room with a strong third quarter and continued to apply pressure into the fourth, leading by six, with six minutes left in the game. However, Milwaukee did not give up, out - scoring Orlando 17 - 8 in the last six minutes, including a big post - move score by Jabari Parker that put the Bucks up by one with 10 seconds left. The loss snaps the Magic's three - game winning streak, while the Bucks earned their second win in a row. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks in points, rebounds, assists and blocked shots; with 18 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists, three blocked shots and two steals, in 39 minutes. Jabari Parker was a beast as he tallied 26 points (12 - 14 FG, 2 - 3 FT), seven rebounds, five assists and one steal, in 41 minutes. Greg Monroe and Khris Middleton both added 18 points for the Bucks, who shot an impressive 55 percent from the field. Jared Bayless sat this one out with a hyper extended right knee. Six players scored in double digits for the Magic, as Nikola Vucevic led the way with 22 points (10 - 13 FG, 2 - 3 FT), in 21 minutes off the bench. Victor Oladipo finished with 18 points, five assists, five steals, four blocks and three rebounds, while Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier chipped in 14 points each. The Magic racked up an impressive 34 assists on 46 field goals and shot 54 percent from the field but their 20 turnovers served to neutralize those statistics, in a losing effort.

San Antonio absolutely stifled the Thunder, as they held them to 38 percent shooting from the field and 11 percent shooting from long distance. The three - point shooting was ugly all - around though, as the Spurs went 4 - for - 24, while the Thunder went 2 - for - 18. San Antonio also forced Oklahoma City to commit 19 turnovers, while they committed just 11 of their own. Oklahoma City played well in the first half, but scored just 36 points in an ugly second half. The stars did play well though, as Kevin Durant accumulated 28 points, eight assists and four rebounds. Russell Westbrook struggled shooting, but still finished with 19 points, six rebounds and seven assists. Enes Kanter was great off the bench, as he double - doubled in a 11 - point, 17 - rebound performance. Oklahoma City has now lost eight of their last 12 games. Up next for the Thunder is a matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday. San Antonio did what they do best, as they used their elite defense to carry them to a big win. Kawhi Leonard was spectacular, as he totaled 26 points, seven rebounds and three steals while covering Durant. LaMarcus Aldridge also played well, as he scored 24 points and grabbed nine rebounds in the win. This now gives San Antonio 41 - straight wins in their home building.

        "input": "Input text: The Atlanta Hawks (35 - 28) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (40 - 21) 107 - 97 at Staples Center on Saturday. The Hawks demonstrated resiliance throughout the second half matchup after falling behind by double figures early on. Mike Budenholzer received coach of the year honors last season, partly for his ability to adjust midgame, and that was precisely what happened against the Clippers on Saturday. Los Angeles stormed out to what seemed like a devastating first quarter lead, scoring 37 points on lights out shooting, while Chris Paul assisted on play after play. The Hawks turned the quarter early in the second half after Kent Bazemore, Paul Millsap and Al Horford started a scoring run, and they did not have to look back. Jeff Teague and Millsap led the scoring department for Atlanta after scoring they combined for 42 points in the winning effort. Millsap went ballistic on the glass, grabbing 18 rebounds, to go along with five assists on 8 - of - 14 shooting, while Teague dished out seven assists. Bazemore finished with 17 points, five rebounds and two assists, Horford added a double - double with 11 points and 12 rebounds and Korver buried two baskets behind the arc to round out the starters. Dennis Shroder proved once again his value as a backup point guard, and contributed 16 points in 20 minutes. The Clippers showed balance amongst the starters, but no one player was able to take the lead and help out enough in scoring to counteract the Hawks style. DeAndre Jordan scored 17 points, but was overpowered by Millsap's rebounding, even though they were not directly matched up against each other. Chris Paul matched Jordan's 17 points, to go along with 11 assists to complete a double - double. Jeff Green got the starting nod at the forward position and also finished in double figures with 14 points, while Paul Pierce and Kyle Korver also finished with 11 points and 10 points, respectivally. The Clippers will visit the Dallas Mavericks (33 - 29) on Monday, while the hawks will visit the Utah Jazz (29 - 33) on Tuesday. Table format: <NEWLINE>  There are two tables.

Chicago came out sharp and jumped to a 32 - 26 lead by the end of the first quarter. The Thunder fought back and finished the half on a 15 - 3 run that brought it to 54 - 52 at halftime. Despite a few quick runs by the Thunder, the Bulls managed to hold the lead the entire game. The Bulls doubled up the Thunder with a 32 - 16 third quarter and cruised to the finish from there. Jimmy Butler led the Bulls in scoring, with 23 points (9 - 20 FG), along with six rebounds, four assists and four steals, in 42 minutes. Pau Gasol tallied a solid double - double with 21 points (8 - 16 FG, 5 - 6 FT) and 13 rebounds. Gasol also dished six assists and blocked two shots, in 37 minutes. Taj Gibson also tallied a double - double, with 13 points (6 - 8 FG) and 10 rebounds, along with two assists, two blocks and one steal, in 34 minutes. The Bulls grabbed 53 rebounds, a testament to the intensity and focus that they maintained throughout the game. They also shot 90 percent from the free throw line, hitting 18 - 20 as a team. Kevin Durant put on a stellar performance and was leaning toward a triple - double after he did everything he could to help his team, yet it was not enough to get over the hump. Durant finished with 29 points (11 - 21 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), nine rebounds and seven assists, in 42 minutes. Russell Westbrook struggled shooting, going 9 - 23 from the field, 1 - 7 from long range and 7 - 13 from the free throw line, on his way to 26 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. Westbrook grabbed an impressive six steals, however his six turnovers nullified that hard work on defense. Enes Kanter put up solid numbers in 25 minutes off the bench, finishing with 14 points (6 - 12 FG) and 13 rebounds. With this loss, the Thunder are now 6 - 8 versus the East. Next the Thunder will host the Nuggets on Sunday. The Bulls will be right back in action with a game on Saturday in Dallas. Table format: There are two tables in the text.

        "input": "Input text: The Chicago Bulls (20) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (0 - 2) 91 - 82 on Monday at the United center in Chicago in game two of their first round matchup of the Eastern Conference playoffs. In a chippy game featuring seven technical fouls and an ejection (Zaza Pachulia), the Bulls were able to have a big fourth quarter to pull out the nine - point win and grab a two - game lead in the series. The Bucks had a strong defensive effort in the first half, forcing the Bulls into 11 turnovers before the break, but they were unable to get anything going offensively and the Bulls took a one - point lead into the half. It was the fourth quarter where the Bulls took the advantage though, as they went on a 130 run with six minutes left in the game to put them up 10 fueled by Jimmy Butler, who was nearly unstoppable in this outing. Including that huge final quarter, Butler finished with a game - high of 31 points (10 - 19 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 8 - 14 FT), while adding nine rebounds and two assists over 46 minutes. Butler got into a shoving match with OJ Mayo earlier in the second quarter which led to a few technicals, but that really seemed to fuel his intensity and he never looked back. Derrick Rose struggled mightily in the first half, going scoreless on 0 - for - 7 shooting from the field. He clearly made some adjustments at half though and salvaged his performance with 15 points (4 - 14 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT), seven rebounds and nine assists. Helping to give the Bulls an impressive 64 - 48 rebounding advantage was the duo of Pau Gasol and Joakim Noah, who combined to record 35 of the team's 64 rebounds. Gasol finished with 11 points (4 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT), 16 rebounds and four blocked shots, while Noah added six points (3 - 9 FG), 19 rebounds and five assists. After Nikola Mirotic went to the floor and got into a tussle with Zaza Pachulia, he had to leave with a knee injury, but it's unclear how that will affect his status moving forward. Khris Middleton did everything he could to keep the Bucks close. He went into the half leading all scorers with 12 points and then went on to score a team - high of 22 points (8 - 20 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), to go along with six rebounds and a steal over 38 minutes. Middleton had 18 points in game one on Saturday as well, but he just has n't gotten enough scoring help to stay even with the Bulls. The only other Buck in double - digit points was Michael Carter-Williams, who posted 12 points (5 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), five rebounds and two assists. Both Giannis Antetokounmpo and Ersan Ilyasova struggled with their shots. They combined to shoot a meager 5 - for - 21 from the field and 0 - for - 3 from the three - point line for 14 points. Antetokounmpo added 11 rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots, but it just was n't enough in the end. Despite forcing the Bulls into 15 total turnovers, while committing just four of their own, the Bucks just could n't establish enough of an offensive presence to keep up in the end. These two teams will now head to Milwaukee for game three of the series on Thursday. Table format: <NEWLINE>  There are two tables. The first table has 9 columns and 2 rows.

With the victory over the Spurs, the Grizzlies continue to make their case as one of the best teams in the Western Conference. Behind a strong first half, where Memphis out - scored San Antonio 52 - 38, the Grizzlies were able to coast to a victory in front of their home crowd. They also used a solid outing from the three - point line where they went 47 percent compared to the Spurs who went only 23 percent. Mike Conley was huge in this game and was the biggest reason the Grizzlies secured the victory. He went 10 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 5 from the three - point line to finish with 30 points, while also adding seven rebounds and six assists. He's now combined for 54 points in his last two outings, as he's been dialed in with his shot. Marc Gasol also played well and came one rebound shy of a double - double. He finished with 17 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 7 FT), nine rebounds and five assists. While he did n't reach his season average of 20 points per game, it was still a very positive all - around effort. They only other player to reach double figures was Tayshaun Prince, who had 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) off the bench. The Spurs just did n't have their strongest offensive game in this one. With Tony Parker sitting out, Cory Joseph got the start at point guard and tied for a team - high of 18 points (9 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 0 - 1 FT). He's combined for 52 points over his last three outings, so he's done well lately. Marco Belinelli matched Joseph, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from beyond the arc to score 18 points in 35 minutes. It was one of his better games of the season, as he was averaging 10 points per game coming in. The only other player to reach double - figures was Patty Mills, who chipped in 10 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) off the bench.

        "input": "Input text: The Charlotte Hornets (15 - 10) defeated the Toronto Raptors (16 - 11) 109 - 99 in overtime on Thursday. The Hornets' prized offseason acquisition, Nicolas Batum, left Wednesday night's contest versus the Magic with an illness. That same malady extended into Thursday, opening up the starting opportunity for Jeremy Lin. The six - year pro had his best scoring game in over two years, tallying a game - high 35 points on outstanding 13 of 22 shooting from the field. The total included a pair of three - pointers, and was amassed over a robust 47 minutes. Lin's previous scoring high on the season was 19 points, but the 27 - year - old showed that he is still highly capable of a breakout performance when given extended opportunity. The player who had considerable trouble defending Lin, DeMar DeRozan, nevertheless had a stellar offensive showing of his own. The Raptors' shooting guard collected a team - high 31 points and added five assists, four rebounds, a steal and a block. The outing was DeRozan's fifth consecutive game with 20 or more points. His trusty backcourt mate Kyle Lowry pitched in with 20 points, but needed an astounding amount of shot attempts to get there. Lowry was an atrocious 6 of 29 from the field, including 3 for 17 from beyond the arc. Bismack Biyombo and Terrence Ross both provided solid contributions, with the former accumulating a season - high 18 rebounds (along with eight points), and the latter pouring in 17 points on the strength of a season - high five three - pointers. The Raptors fell to 16 - 11 but remain in first place in the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division. They head to Miami to take on the Heat on Friday. Kemba Walker was the second member of the Hornets' backcourt to spearhead Charlotte's offensive attack, supporting Lin's effort with 27 points of his own. He added seven assists, six rebounds, a pair of blocks and a steal. Marvin Williams contributed a 10 - point, 10 - rebound double - double, while P.J. Hairston pitched in with a second straight 14 - point performance that included a season - high four three - pointers. One of those long - range buckets came with 1:30 left in the overtime period and gave the home team a lead they would not relinquish. Spencer Hawes was highly productive off the bench, collecting a modest five points but hauling in an impressive 10 boards. He added four assists, three steals and a block in a highly efficient 23 minutes of action. The Hornets improved to 15 - 10 and currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They head to Washington for a Saturday night showdown with the Wizards.

The Pelicans (27 - 40) opened up an early lead Tuesday and never let go of it, as after entering halftime with a 14 - point edge and ultimately going into the final period with a insurmountable 23 - point lead. It did n't come without an injury scare, however, as Anthony Davis left in the second quarter with an ankle injury, but after X-rays came back negative, the star big man returned to the game after halftime. Davis still managed to finished with 15 points and 15 rebounds in 29 minutes Tuesday, while DeMarcus Cousins scored a team - high 22 points to go along with nine rebounds, three assists and three steals. In the end, it was a total team effort for New Orleans, with a total of six Pelicans players scoring in double figures. As for the Trail Blazers (29 - 37), it was complete opposite kind of effort. It was a one - man show, with Damian Lillard scoring a game - high 29 points on 8 - of - 18 shooting from the field in just 31 minutes. Only one of his teammates, however, managed to score in double figures, with the team's next highest scorer being Shabazz Napier, who had 10 points in 19 minutes. As a team, it was a shooting night to forget for Portland, as the team shot just 30 percent from the field and 34 percent from the three - point line. It was the first time the Trail Blazers failed to score 100 points in 10 games.

Phoenix then came roaring back to take a five - point lead with five minutes remaining, and that was a lead they never lost. Eric Bledsoe nearly had a triple - double on the evening, recording a team - high 21 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists in 35 minutes. Meanwhile, T.J. Warren continues to make a run at being the NBA's most improved player, scoring 18 points \u2014 the fourth time in five games he has done so. Additionally, Jared Dudley was tremendous off the bench, scoring 19 points while shooting 6 - of - 9 from the field and 4 - of - 6 from behind the arc. The Pistons (4 - 4) have now lost three of their last four games, as they continues to have consistency issues on both sides of the ball.

As a team, despite being in the game until the very end, the Pistons shot a lowly 36 percent (32 - of - 89) from the field.

Gordon Hayward bounced back from his six - point performance Monday to score a game - high 24 points against the Thunder.

Avery Bradley has long been renowned for his stingy defense and known as more of a complementary presence on the offensive side. It was vastly different story Saturday, however, as the veteran guard exploded for 31 points and a career - high 11 rebounds. The scoring total largely consisted of a personal - best eight three - pointers, and he and backcourt mate Isaiah Thomas combined for over half of Boston's points on the night. They also helped the Celtics (2 - 1) tally a 48 percent success rate from the field, including a 48 percent figure from beyond the arc, with the latter number nearly doubling the Hornets' (2 - 1) number. Bradley added four assists and a steal to his stellar stat line. Thomas contributed 24 points and added seven assists and a rebound. Al Horford supplied 14 points, four boards, three assists, two blocks and a steal, while Jae Crowder's full stat line included nine points, nine rebounds, four assists, three blocks and two steals. Kemba Walker once again served as the linchpin of the Charlotte attack, which has been decidedly top - heavy so far this season. He posted 29 points, three assists, two rebounds and three steals. Nicolas Batum had his hands full all night on defense with Bradley and totaled a modest 12 points of his own, along with six assists, four rebounds and a pair of blocks. No other starter managed double - digit scoring, although Cody Zeller, starting at center, did haul in nine rebounds. Frank Kaminsky III paced the bench with 11 points. The Celtics head back home to take on the Bulls on Wednesday, while the Hornets face off with the Sixers in a home tilt Wednesday as well. Table format: There are two tables.

Toronto has won five straight games, knocking down most of the Eastern Conference's lottery contingent over the last week. Six players scored in double figures for the Raptors. Jonas Valanciunas scored a team - high 17 points and pulled down seven rebounds. They continue to win even without DeMar DeRozan (adductor) in the lineup, maintaining their seat atop the Eastern Conference standings, but a scary injury happened to Landry Fields in Friday's game. Fields took a bad fall and had his head hit the court, causing him to suffer a cut in his head that required eight stitches. Considering the serious potential of the situation, Fields came out OK, even passing a concussion test. The Raptors will play the New York Knicks on Sunday. Detroit has lost their last three games, as they were navigating a murder's row of the Clippers, Mavericks and Raptors. Brandon Jennings scored a game - high 22 points, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope backed his play with 18 points in 27 minutes. Jodie Meeks played 25 minutes off the bench but finished with just four points in 25 minutes. Detroit will try to right the ship when they travel to Brooklyn to take on the Nets on Sunday.

The Lakers' frontcourt has been manhandled throughout the season by opposing power forwards and centers, and Saturday night represented another situation ripe for the same type of outcome, considering that Los Angeles would be facing a motivated Dwight Howard. The Rockets' big man, who spent one tumultous season in Los Angeles during the 2012 - 13 campaign, brought his A-game against his former team after back - to - back lackluster performances. The 12 - year pro posted 18 points, 12 rebounds, a pair of assists, a pair of blocks and a steal. It was Howard's seventh double - double of the season, and featured his second - best shooting night of the campaign (88 percent). His dominance was a microcosm of the bigger picture, as Houston outscored the visitors in the paint 62 - 28 and outrebounded them 52 to 40. Los Angeles was led by Kobe Bryant, who managed one of his best games of the season with 25 points, seven assists, six rebounds and three steals over 31 minutes. Lou Williams was solid in another starting opportunity, tallying 15 points, five rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals. D'Angelo Russell could n't put together a third consecutive standout performance, but did pitch in with 12 points, four assists and and three steals. Roy Hibbert (10 points) and Larry Nance, Jr. (eight points) only managed modest contributions, and Nick Young paced the Los Angeles bench with 13 points. The Lakers fell to 3 - 21 and remain in last place in the Western Conference's Pacific Division. They head home to face the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday. In addition to Howard's stellar effort, James Harden led the overall scoring for Houston with 30 points. Clint Capela also produced against the Lakers' vulnerable frontcourt, managing his own double - double with 11 points and 10 rebounds. While the remaining Houston starters only mustered single - digit points, Marcus Thornton paced the Rockets bench with 18 points, while Donatas Motiejunas had his best game since returning from offseason back surgery. The four - year pro managed an impressive 11 points in just 15 minutes, which was his highest allotment of playing time in the four games that he's been active this season. The Rockets improved to 12 - 12 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference's Southwest Division. They travel to Denver to face off against the Nuggets on Monday.

The Clippers came into this game as a monster favorite, but things did n't go as planned. Los Angeles led for the first 45 minutes, but allowed Brooklyn to take their first lead with three minutes left. In fact, the Clippers had an 18 - point lead late in the third quarter, as their backups allowed the Nets to crawl back in and send the game to two overtimes, thanks to a 34 - 21 fourth quarter. Brooklyn missed four free - throws in the final 30 seconds of the first overtime to allow the Clippers to send it to a second OT with a game - tying three. From there, the Nets took over in the second OT and escaped with a needed win. The biggest advantage for Brooklyn was in the paint, as they won that battle 52 - 42. Los Angeles (14 - 5) had to play this game without Blake Griffin and that was simply too much to overcome. DeAndre Jordan stepped up in Griffin's absence though, totaling 21 points and 23 rebounds in the loss. Chris Paul recorded a triple - double, tallying 26 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists. J.J. Redick scored 18 points on an inefficient 7 - of - 18 shooting. Austin Rivers led the bench in scoring, dropping 15 points on 5 - of - 9 shooting. The Clippers have a tough task for their next game as well, as they travel to play the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday. Brooklyn (5 - 12) came into this game in the midst of a seven - game losing streak, but snapped that with a huge upset here. Ironically, that losing streak started at the hands of the Clippers. Sean Kilpatrick went just 14 - of - 34 from the field, but finished with career - high 38 points and 14 rebounds in the win. Brook Lopez had one of his best games of the season as well, as he accumulated 27 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Trevor Booker accrued 15 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and four steals as the starting power forward. Bojan Bogdanovic finished with 14 points and six rebounds of his own.

        "input": "Input text: The Atlanta Hawks (31 - 8) defeated the Boston Celtics (13 - 24) 105 - 91 on Wednesday at the TD Garden in Boston. The Hawks were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three - point line, while the Celtics went just 41 percent from the floor and 33 percent from beyond the arc. The Hawks were also able to force the Celtics into 17 turnovers, while committing only 12 of their own, helping push their winning streak to ten in a row. Both Jeff Teague and DeMarre Carroll stepped up for the Hawks in this game. Teague went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 22 points, while also adding six assists and two steals. He went a perfect 6 - of - 6 from the free throw line, adding a significant portion to his points total. Carroll on the other hand recorded 22 points (8 - 13 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 3 - 5 FT), five rebounds and three assists of his own. Considering he's only averaging 12 points per game so far this season, it was a nice surprise for the Hawks in this one. Paul Millsap had a strong showing as well, contributing 18 points (5 - 10 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 7 - 7 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. The double - double marked his ninth of the season thus far. The only other Hawk to reach double figures in points was Mike Scott, who came off the bench to score 11 points (4 - 8 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) in 22 minutes. Jared Sullinger and Avery Bradley, the Celtics season scoring leaders, again had the most production for the Celtics. Bradley went 6 - for - 13 from the floor and 3 - for - 7 from beyond the arc to finish with a team - high of 17 points. He's averaging 18 points per game over his last five matchups, as he's done the bulk of the scoring since Jeff Green was sent to the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade. Sullinger came one rebound shy of a double - double, recording 14 points and nine rebounds in 36 minutes. The double - double would have been his third in a row, but his streak ends at two instead. With the rest of the starters struggling to get anything going, the Celtics did see a few of their bench players step up. Kelly Olynyk went 5 - for - 10 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to add 12 points and eight rebounds off the bench. Marcus Thornton was the other bench player to reach double - digit points, with 10 (4 - 9 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt) in 21 minutes. The Hawks' next game will be on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Friday, while the Celtics will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday. Table format: <NEWLINE>  There are two tables.

Utah has one more game on their five - game Eastern Conference road trip. They'll go on to Toronto to finish off their back - to - back set against the Raptors on Saturday. Carmelo Anthony's 46 points were impressive, but they were n't enough to earn the win for the Knicks. Only one other Knicks player, Pablo Prigioni scored in double - digits. Prigioni finished with 13 points in 29 minutes off the bench. New York is struggling to find their groove this season, and with defensive wing Iman Shumpert going down with right hip contusion Friday, they'll have another hurdle to jump.

This was a good old fashion Western Conference game with a ton of scoring and competitive play. Both teams offenses looked as efficient as ever, as they both were hovering around 50 percent from the field and over 40 percent from three - point range. No team really got a big lead in this game and it was nip - and - tuck throughout. The ball movement was the big difference for the Warriors, as they recorded 35 assists to the Rockets 21. That's no surprise with Golden State ranking first in the NBA in assists. Golden state looked like a shell of themselves in their last game without Steph Curry, but looked like the Warriors we all know and love here. The team was moving the ball around like they have been all season and playing the great team - ball they are known for. Draymond Green played distributor tonight en route to his fifth triple - double, as he dished out 16 assists to go with 11 points and 10 rebounds. Klay Thompson was great as well, as he recorded 38 points and seven rebounds. This small break without Curry may be just what this team needs to continue their historic run at that elusive 72 - win mark. The Warriors will take on the Denver Nuggets in their next game on Saturday. The Rockets played extremely well here, but fell just short against a better team. The combination of James Harden and Dwight Howard were the stars on Thursday and they need them to continue to play at this level all season. Harden tallied 30 points, five rebounds and five assists while Howard collected 21 points, 13 rebounds, five assists, three blocks and two steals. Those two playing at that type of level has been a rare sight this season and if they want to make another deep run, this form will need to carry over. Houston will have another tough task on Saturday, as they have to take on the San Antonio Spurs in a building where they haven\u2019t lost in this season. Not to mention that that's a revenge game with the Rockets beating the Spurs on Christmas. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has 5 columns and 2 rows.

In fact, none of the three other starters have scored in double figures for the fourth - straight game. This particular matchup was full of swings in the second half, as the Kings outscored the Hawks 37 - 26 in the third, with Atlanta countering with a 27 - 14 fourth quarter of their own. Despite both teams failing to crack 70 percent from the free - throw line, the 16 more makes and 18 more attempts played a huge factor in the Hawks' win. Dwight Howard's 8 - for - 20 from the line was a major part of that, as the Kings were not allowing him to finish at the basket. Another key for Atlanta was offensive rebounding, as they snatched down 17 boards while holding Sacramento to just six of its own.

        "input": "Input text: The Houston Rockets (47 - 23) defeated the Indiana Pacers (30 - 40) 110 - 100 on Monday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. After winning seven games in a row during the start of March and pushing themselves into the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference standings, the Pacers have now turned completely in the opposite direction and have gone on to lose six straight games. The loss does n't take them out of the playoff race though, as they sit just a game back from the Charlotte Hornets for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the East. The Rockets, on the other hand, were on a poor streak of their own, as they were losers of four straight. The win gets them back on the right track though, as they still hold a two - game lead over the Portland Trail Blazers for the third projected playoff seed in the Western Conference. The Rockets shot fairly well in this game, going 48 percent from the field and 54 percent from the three - point line. James Harden was nearly unstoppable, as he went off for a game - high of 44 points (10 - 21 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt, 21 - 22 FT), to go along with four rebounds, seven assists and two steals. He continues to make his push for the league MVP, as this was the second time in three games that he's posted over 40 points. During that three - game stretch, Harden has averaged an impressive 37 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists. Donatas Motiejunas also played a big factor in the win, going 6 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 17 points. It was his third time shooting over 60 percent from the field during the last four games, as his shot is clearly dialed in at the moment. The Rockets also saw some solid contributions from their bench, with both Josh Smith and Corey Brewer reaching double figures in points. Smith finished with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt) and five rebounds, while Brewer had 11 points (2 - 6 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt) and two rebounds. Also, Patrick Beverley had to leave the game with a wrist injury after just 20 minutes and was n't able to return, so it's questionable how severe his injury could be. C.J. Watson had a big performance off the bench for the Pacers. He went 7 - for - 10 from the field and 4 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 23 points, while also adding five assists over 30 minutes. After going 0 - for - 6 from beyond the arc during Saturday's game against the Brooklyn Nets, Watson was able to turn things back around and get pointed in the right direction Monday. George Hill also played well despite suffering the loss. He led the starters with 20 points (9 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 0 - 1 FT), to go along with six rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocked shots, as he did a little bit of everything for the Pacers. He's shot over 50 percent in each of his last three games, a stretch where he's currently averaging 21 points as the scoring leader for this team. Notching his first double - double in six games was Roy Hibbert, who posted 18 points (8 - 12 FG, 2 - 2 FT) and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. David West also reached double - digit points with 10 (4 - 13 FG, 2 - 4 FT) of his own, despite struggling from the field. The Rockets' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, while the Pacers will travel to Washington to play the Wizards on Wednesday.

With the Thunder trailing by one with nine seconds to play, Kevin Durant missed a pull - up jumper and Tyreke Evans came down with the board. In an effort to run time off the clock, Evans attempted to throw the ball into the backcourt, but Durant picked off the heave. He\u2019d miss a floater in the lane, and Davis brought down the rebound and went to the free throw line with less than three second remaining. Davis hit both free throws, putting New Orleans up 113 - 110. On the ensuing Thunder possession, Russell Westbrook caught the inbounds pass and was fouled on a three - point attempt by Quincy Pondexter. Westbrook hit all three free throws, tying the game with 2 seconds remaining. The Pelicans called timeout to advance the ball, and inbounded to Davis, who double - clutched at the top of the key and drilled a three with two defenders in the vicinity. Davis finished with 41 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks, helping the Pelicans avenge Wednesday\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City. Evans added 22 points for New Orleans, while Ryan Anderson had 17 off the bench. Pondexter finished with 15 points, including three three - pointers.

At this rate, anything less than a monster double - double will be a disappointment for Andre Drummond. The Pistons\u2019 superstar center tallied his 11th straight performance with double - digit points and boards, meaning he\u2019s achieved the feat in each of Detroit\u2019s contests this season. He contributed a team - high 25 points and 18 rebounds Tuesday to spearhead an impressive victory, which featured Detroit rallying after entering the fourth quarter trailing 81 - 75. The Cavs were led by LeBron James, who contributed a game - high 30 points. The remaining four starters accounted for virtually the rest of the Cleveland offense, as the bench could only pitch in 10 points overall. Kevin Love backed up James\u2019 effort with a 19 - point, nine - rebound outing, while J.R. Smith and Mo Williams notably pitched in 15 points apiece. Cleveland fell to 8 - 3 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference\u2019s Central Division. They head home to face the Bucks on Thursday. Drummond wasn\u2019t the only Piston lighting up the scoreboard Tuesday, as Reggie Jackson bounced back from a tough outing Sunday versus the Lakers by contributing a double - double of his own. The Detroit point guard poured in 23 points while handing out 12 assists, several to teammate Ersan Ilyasova, who posted a season high 20 points of his own. The streaky Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the dependable Marcus Morris made it a perfect five - for - five in double - digit scoring for the Pistons starters, with 13 and 14 points, respectively. The Pistons improved to 6 - 5 and reside in third place in the Eastern Conference\u2019s Central Division. They now travel to Minnesota for a Friday date with the Timberwolves.

The Clippers (29 - 14) rolled past the Thunder (25 - 18) at home en route to a seventh straight victory. The absence of Steven Adams in the paint proved to be vital for Oklahoma City as they relied to heavily on the leadership of Russell Westbrook. Adams, who is dealing with a concussion, was sidelined for the tilt. DeAndre Jordan was able to wreak havoc in the paint without Adams there to protect the rim and he went for a big double - double to the tune of 19 points and 15 rebounds. The Clippers took an early lead into the second quarter and were able to continue to pour on the points making the game a healthy blowout by the end of the third quarter. Marreese Speights pitched in one of his best performances of the season in leading the bench. Speights finished with 23 points, 10 rebounds and three assists on 8 - of - 15 shooting. Chris Paul left the game with a sprained thumb after registering 14 minutes of action, but he was not needed to continue the blowout down the stretch. Raymond Felton, who has been tasked with starting point guard minutes throughout parts of the season, finished with 15 points and six assists in 27 minutes. Russell Westbrook fell far short of his triple - double average after going for 24 points, five rebounds and four assists. The Thunder opted to play small ball and not start a center, however, Enes Kanter played 23 minutes at the center position off the bench and scored 12 points. Next up, the Clippers host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday, while the Thunder visit the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday. Table format: There are two tables.

Sacramento had a firm hold on the game through the first three quarters, but a late fourth - quarter push by Detroit brought them within five. However, that is as close as they would get, as the Kings countered with a 70 run of their own and ultimately put the game out of reach. DeMarcus Cousins dominated in the first half for the Kings, scoring 23 points, and the big man from Kentucky ended up with a game - high 33 points and nine rebounds in 38 minutes. He continues to show his improved ability to stretch the floor, as Cousins shot 3 - for - 5 from behind the arc. Rajon Rondo stuffed the stat sheet, recording his second triple - double of the season of 14 points, 11 rebounds and 15 assists in 47 minutes. Rudy Gay shot efficiently, going 10 - of - 14 from the field and finishing with 25 points in 37 minutes. For the Pistons, Andre Drummond recorded his eighth straight double - double to start the season, finishing with 14 points and 16 rebounds in 35 minutes. Three other Detroit starters in Marcus Morris (16), Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (15) and Reggie Jackson (16) managed to score in double figures, but the team\u2019s bench only recorded 23 total points.

The Celtics led 45 - 37 after a low - scoring first half but the Nets came out strong in the second half and were able to gain the lead for a few minutes in the fourth. The Celtics quickly took the advantage once more, leading by eight with 2:9 left in the game. However, the Celtics would not get away easy, as the Nets brought it back to a one - possession game, with a chance to inbound the ball with nine seconds remaining. They got two three - point attempts within that final nine seconds that could have tied it up, yet thankfully for Boston, neither of them fell, allowing the Celtics to escape with the win. Five players scored in double digits for the Celtics (44 - 25), led by Jae Crowder, who double - doubled with 24 points and 12 rebounds, in 35 minutes. Avery Bradley followed up with 16 points and five rebounds, while Al Horford chipped in 12 points, eight rebounds, four assists, four blocks and one steal. The Celtics were without their all star, Isaiah Thomas (knee), but Marcus Smart stepped in to run the point, contributing 12 points, five assists, three rebounds and three steals. The Celtics look ahead to their next contest on Sunday in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Brook Lopez led the way for the Nets (13 - 55) with 23 points on 8 - of - 18 shooting, to go along with five rebounds, four assists and two blocks, in 31 minutes.

The Hawks built on an 11 - points halftime lead by using a 27 - 7 run to lead by 26 after the third quarter. It was another embarrassing loss for the 76ers, who basically used every healthy player off their bench and somehow managed to out rebound the Hawks 32 - 25. Atlanta's 127 points was a season high as the Hawks shot an unconscious 62 percent from the field (48 - for - 78). The lone 76er who did not enter the game Wednesday was Nerlens Noel, who was held out for a second consecutive contest due to an eye injury he suffered last weekend. Fortunately for Philadelphia, Noel should be back in time for Friday's game against the rival Knicks. This game would have gotten uglier has it not been for the shooting of Isaiah Canaan, who scored a game - high 24 points (7 - 12 FG, 6 - 8 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT). Atlanta managed to snap a three - game losing streak and had one of its best offensive games of the season. One of the many differences on the night was the turnover battle, which the Hawks won 22 - 12. They also made the 76ers pay from beyond the arc, shooting 10 - of - 21 from distance (48 percent). Paul Millsap scored 14 of his 21 points in the third quarter and shot 7 - of - 8 from the field as the Hawks were able to extend the lead and out Philadelphia in an insurmountable hole.

        "input": "Input text: The Minnesota Timberwolves (16 - 54) defeated the Utah Jazz (31 - 39) 106 - 104 on Monday at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City. After Trey Burke hit two free throws to put the Utah Jazz up by three with just under 20 seconds left in the game, rookie guard Zach LaVine came back and hit a three - pointer for the Timberwolves to tie the game with just over 12 seconds left in regulation. Burke then had a chance to win it at the buzzer, but he missed a three - point shot and it went to overtime. While it was a close overtime battle, the Timberwolves were able to come out on top, securing the two - point victory on the road, something they've only done seven times this season. Including two three - pointers in the final 22 seconds of regulation that kept Minnesota in the game and some clutch free throws at the end of overtime, LaVine was the star for the Timberwolves Monday. He went 7 - for - 19 from the field and 5 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 27 points, while also posting four assists in 46 minutes. It was a career - high in points for the guard, who's now scored 20 points or more three times over his last five games. During that five - game stretch, he's averaging 15 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists as he's beginning to find his groove. Do n't overlook the performance from Andrew Wiggins though, who finished with 22 points (10 - 19 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT) of his own, to go along with seven rebounds and two steals. He's shot the ball well of late, going 50 percent or higher from the field in three out of his last four games. Coming off the bench, Chase Budinger added 15 points (4 - 13 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) and five assists, while Sean Kilpatrick added a career - high of 13 points (4 - 7 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) in just his second NBA regular season game ever. With Gordon Hayward out due to a collarbone injury, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert did everything they could to keep the Jazz afloat. Each recorded a double - double, as Favors posted 19 points (8 - 13 FG, 3 - 7 FT) and 12 rebounds, while Gobert had 18 points (7 - 11 FG, 4 - 8 FT), 17 rebounds and six blocked shots. Favors has posted two double - doubles in a row now, combining for 40 points and 23 rebounds during that span. Starting for Hayward, Joe Ingles made the most of the start, going 7 - for - 10 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 18 points. It was a season - high in points for Ingles, who's only reached double - digit points in 10 games this season. Trey Burke really struggled with his shot off the bench, but still chipped in with 16 points (4 - 22 FG, 2 - 13 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), six assists and four steals in 38 minutes. The Jazz's next game will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will be at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday.

Depite playing without Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook, the Thunder were still able to get the job done. They showed up big on Wednesday, grabbing a 15 - point win over the Celtics. Oklahoma City was led by a big game from Reggie Jackson, who had 28 points (8 - 15 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 10 - 10 FT), along with eight assists, three rebounds and one steal. They also got an impressive performance off the bench from Anthony Morrow, who scored 28 points (11 - 16 FG, 4 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), with five rebounds and one assist. This was just one game after making his season debut, after being held out of the beginning of the year with an MCL injury. Oklahoma City heads back home now, and they'll take on the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. The Celtics saw all five of their starters score in double figures, but their bench could only manage 15 total points on Wednesday. They were led by a near triple - double from Rajon Rondo, who had 20 points (8 - 15 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt), 12 assists and nine rebounds. Jared Sullinger also had a nice game, scoring 14 points (7 - 13 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt), along with 11 rebounds and six assists for his own double - double. The Celtics will now get a night off before LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers come to town on Friday night. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has 5 columns and 2 rows.

If this keeps up, DeMar DeRozan's approval rating in Washington is going to sink faster than that of some politicans.The Raptors' shooting guard has been positively deadly against the Wizards this season, and particularly the last two games. Just eight days ago, he blasted Washington for 34 points, six rebounds, five assists, a pair of steals and a pair of blocks in Toronto. Friday, the nation's capital was the scene of the crime, with the 26 - year - old besting his prior effort by tallying 35 points, equaling his season high with eight rebounds, and adding an assist, a block and a steal. Factoring in his 20 - point outing in the season's initial meeting between the two teams back on Nov. 28, DeRozan has now averaged just under 30 points per contest against one of the worst defenses in the league versus shooting guards. Backcourt mate Kyle Lowry played second banana to DeRozan on this night, but still managed an impressive double - double. He totaled 21 points and added 10 boards, four assists, four steals and a block, with the only blemish being his six turnovers. Luis Scola was the only other starter whose points reached double figures, with the power forward posting 11 points and hauling in five rebounds. Corey Joseph led the reserves with eight points, four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. The Raptors improved to 23 - 15 and remain atop the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division. They head to Philadelphia for a Saturday showdown with the Sixers. As customary, John Wall led the way for Washington with 21 points, four assists and three blocks. However, like his counterpart on the Raptors, he was a bit careless with the ball, committing seven turnovers. Otto Porter was next on the totem pole, collecting 16 points, five rebounds, three assists, a pair of steals and a block. Marcin Gortat, who along with Wall has been one of the main sources of offensive production during Bradley Beal's absence, was the only other starter with double - digit points. The Wizards' big man posted a 12 - point, 10 - rebound double - double that he supplemented with three assists and three blocks. Ramon Sessions put together one of his typically productive efforts off the bench to pace the Washington reserves, pouring in 14 points and adding four rebounds, an assist and a block. The Wizards fell to 15 - 19 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They head to Orlando for a Saturday afternoon showdown versus the Magic.

Mo Williams (illness) returned to action after a one - game absence to put up 25 points and 11 assists in 30 minutes. Zach LaVine moved back to a bench role, but that did n't stop him from having the best game of his rookie career. He put up a game - high 28 points in 26 minutes. Thaddeus Young coaxed the Lakers' Nick Young into fouling him with 3 seconds left and the game tied. Young stepped to the line and missed his first free throw before sinking the second to secure the win for the Timberwolves. Minnesota's next game is on the road against the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday. Los Angeles has lost four straight games. Kobe Bryant put up a last - second shot to try and steal the game after Young's free throws, but he missed the mark. The Lakers were terrific on offense, shooitng 54 percent from the field, but they did n't have the defense to stop the injury - depleted Timberwolves. They allowed Minnesota to shoot 57 percent from the field and 56 percent from beyond the arc. The Lakers will host the Toronto Raptors on Sunday. Table format: There are two tables.

        "input": "Input text: The Houston Rockets (4 - 1) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (1 - 4) 103 - 94 on Tuesday at the Toyota Center in Houston. Coming out with just their second playoff series win in the last 18 years, the Rockets were able to close out the Mavericks in front of their home crowd. Houston got off to a quick start Tuesday, out - scoring the Mavericks 31 - 22 right away in the first quarter. The Mavericks were able to slowly make their way back throughout the game though, eventually coming to within five points with just over two minutes left in the game. The Rockets never let off the gas pedal though and closed out strong for the series clinching nine - point victory. The Rockets finished at 45 percent from the field and 32 percent from the three - point line, while the Mavericks shot 38 percent from the floor and just 19 percent from deep. Superstars James Harden and Dwight Howard were the biggest reasons that the Rockets were finally able to take the next step in the playoffs. Howard finished with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 4 - 10 FT), 19 rebounds and four blocked shots, while Harden recorded a game - high of 28 points (9 - 19 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), to go along with eight assists. Howard was a force on the boards, helping the Rockets secure a 53 - 47 rebounding advantage. It marked his 32nd career playoff game with at least 15 rebounds. Harden, on the other hand, did what he does best and that's score the ball at a very high rate. The Mavericks just did n't have an answer for him on the defensive side of the ball and he continued his season dominance. The Rockets also continued to reap the benefits of their Josh Smith pickup this season. He shot an impressive 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 20 points off the bench, while also adding eight rebounds over 22 minutes. He averaged 17 points and 6 rebounds during this five - game series. Monta Ellis and Dirk Nowitzki did everything they could to keep the Mavericks' alive in the playoffs. Ellis finished with 25 points (11 - 26 FG, 2 - 7 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), seven assists and four steals, while Nowitzki had 22 points (8 - 23 FG, 0 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 8 FT) and 14 rebounds. Nowitzki really struggled with his shot early in the game, as he was never really able to get himself into a groove, but he played with a lot of heart and continually tried to bring his team back. Ellis, on the other hand, had a nice game shooting the ball. He did seem to bang up his knee late in the fourth quarter, so that's something to watch heading into the offseason. Al-Forouq Aminu had a solid showing as well, finishing with 14 points (3 - 8 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT), nine rebounds and five steals. He's been a pleasant surprise for the Mavericks all series long, and it looks as if he has established himself as a valuable player moving forward into next season. The Rockets will now await the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers/San Antonio Spurs series, which is currently tied at 2 - 2. Table format: There are two tables.

The Clippers pulled off an impressive win in Minnesota thanks to a 39 - point fourth quarter. Los Angeles outscored Minnesota 39 - 29 in those final 12 minutes and took an interesting strategy to a win. They continues to foul in the final 30 seconds when up by three and made it a free - throw competition. In fact, there were nearly 20 free - throw attempts combined in the final 30 seconds. The Clippers shot 26 - for - 19 from the charity stripe and that proved to be the difference in the game. The Clippers have now won five of their last six games and things are turning around. Chris Paul and J.J. Redick seemed very unlikely to play in this game, but both started and played well. DeAndre Jordan was the hero tonight though, as he tallied 20 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks in the win. Jamal Crawford also had a great game off the bench, as he contributed 18 points and seven assists as well. This team has all the talent in the world and it appears to be finally coming together. Los Angeles will look to add to this hot stretch when they take on the struggling Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday. The Timberwolves looked in control of this game in the third quarter, but couldn\u2019t hold off the Clippers. They are now 2 - 9 at home this season and that\u2019s something they'll need to figure out over time. The bench was a bright spot in the loss though, as they totaled 59 points between five players. The Wolves best player on Monday was Ricky Rubio, as he amassed 16 points, seven assists, five rebounds and four steals in the defeat. Even with the home struggles, they should have a good chance at a win when they host the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday in their next scheduled game. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has 5 columns: Losses, Total points, Points in 4th quarter, Wins, and Timberwolves/Clippers. There are 2 rows: Timberwolves and Clippers.   The second table has 7 columns: Assists, Blocks, Points, Total rebounds, Steals, DeAndre Jordan/Jamal Crawford/Ricky Rubio. There are 3 rows: DeAndre Jordan, Jamal Crawford, Ricky Rubio.",

Playing early in the day as the NBA celebrates Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the Wizards jumped out to a double - digit lead in the first quarter and never looked back. The advantage was 23 points at halftime, and Washington continued to pour it on in the second half, even with most of its regulars resting. The Wizards won every quarter and outscored Philadelphia 26 - 18 in the fourth en route to the 35 - point margin of victory. Washington had seven players in double - figures, including all five starters. Marcin Gortat\u2019s 20 points and eight rebounds led the way, while Nene added 12 points and six boards in 18 minutes. John Wall and Brad Beal chipped in 11 and 10 points, respectively, and Wall added 10 assists. Otto Porter scored 10 points off the bench, and Kevin Seraphin added 14 to go with nine rebounds. The Wizards turned it over 22 times as a team but were able to compensate with 56 percent shooting and a 53 - 30 rebounding advantage. Philadelphia shot a measly 33 percent from the floor and knocked down only six of its 24 three - point attempts. While Henry Sims (13 points) and Robert Covington (10) turned in solid performances, the rest of the starting five combined for just 21 points on 8 - of - 31 shooting. Michael Carter-Williams, in particular, struggled, scoring just seven points on 2 - of - 13 shooting. The Sixers have now dropped two straight since beating the Pelicans on Friday.

Memphis came into this game as a double - digit underdog, but walked away with a huge win. Zach Randolph returned from a seven - game absence and was clearly the star, as he recorded his first career triple - double. The key for the Grizzlies was the rebounding, as they snatched down 44 rebounds to the Clippers 30. Los Angeles hasn\u2019t been playing their best ball recently and this may be their worst loss in that stretch. Chris Paul still showed up though, as he tallied 25 points and six assists in the defeat. DeAndre Jordan was the only other player who scored more than 12, as he totaled 16 points, seven rebounds, two blocks and two steals. The Clippers have a quick turnaround, as they play the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday in their next matchup. The Grizzlies continue to surprise and these sort of wins are a credit to their resiliency and grittiness. Zach Randolph played one of his best games of his career, as he accumulated 29 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in the win. Tony Allen continued his offensive surge as well, as he scored 22 of his own. JaMychal Green was a great energizer off the bench, as he amassed 11 points, seven rebounds, four assists and four steals. The Grizzlies will look to build off this win against the Phoenix Suns on Monday. Table format: There are two tables. The first table has 5 columns and 3 rows.

The two teams had already engaged in a tight defensive battle in the second game of the season, with the Cavs emerging as 94 - 91 victors. Tuesday saw a completely different game unfold, with both teams exploding for some of their best point totals of the season. As usual, Cleveland (8 - 1) was led by the Big Three of Kyrie Irving, LeBron James and Kevin Love, who combined for 71 of the Cavs' 121 points, which included double - doubles from the latter two. Strong performances from Tristan Thompson and Channing Frye also helped lead to a stellar 53 percent team tally from the field. The Raptors (7 - 3) were led by Kyle Lowry, who posted a near double - double with 28 points, nine assists, five rebounds and four steals. DeMar DeRozan followed with 26 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals, but struggled from the field, going just 10 - of - 27. Jonas Valanciunas compiled 14 points, nine rebounds and a pair of dimes. Norman Powell drew the start at small forward and contributed 12 points, three rebounds, three assists and a block. Terrence Ross paced the reserves with an 18 - point effort that he complemented with three rebounds and two steals. His impressive performance included a 4 - of - 7 tally from three - point range. James scored a team - high 28 points and added 14 assists, nine boards and a steal, but committed a game - high five turnovers as well. Irving supplied 24 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals, although he also handed the ball to the opposition on five occasions. Love registered a 19 - point, 13 - rebound double - double that also included an assist and three blocks. Thompson got in on the act with 15 points, 11 boards and a block, while Frye paced the bench with 21 points in just 20 minutes. He also hit a huge three - point jumper with 59 seconds remaining that gave Cleveland a 117 - 115 lead that they would n't relinquish again.

Despite a 41 - point fourth quarter, the Mavericks were n't able to buckle down defensively Tuesday and let the Suns score 124 points, giving them the nine - point victory. Despite shooting better from the field and out - rebounding the Suns 49 - 44, the Mavericks committed 20 turnovers, giving the Suns enough of an advantage to secure the victory at home. The Suns found production from all over the court. Goran Dragic led all scorers, going 10 - for - 17 from the floor and 2 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 25 points. He's now averaging 16 points per game on the season. Despite struggling with his shot, Eric Bledsoe had a huge game, scoring 16 points (6 - 19 FG, 1 - 7 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), while recording 11 assists and 10 rebounds, giving him his second triple - double of the season. He was getting everything he wanted in this one, and was a big reason for the Suns' victory. Alex Len also was big as he finished with 17 points (6 - 9 FG, 5 - 7 FT) and seven rebounds before fouling out. The bench had a strong showing from Gerald Green and Isaiah Thomas. Green totaled 22 points, while Thomas finished with 12. The Mavericks were led by the duo of Tyson Chandler and Dirk Nowitzki. Chandler was a force, scoring 22 points (6 - 8 FG, 10 - 12 FT) and grabbing 14 rebounds. It was his thirteenth double - double of the season and third straight game with at least 14 rebounds. Nowitzki shot 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from deep to score 22 points, while also grabbing five rebounds. It was the most points he's had in the last four games. In Rondo's third game with the team, he finished with 13 points (6 - 14 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt), six rebounds and eight assists, as he did a little bit of everything Tuesday. Also, coming off the bench, Charlie Villanueva had a strong showing, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 9 from beyond the arc to score 18 points. The Suns' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Friday, while the Mavericks will be at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. Table format: There are 2 tables.

Los Angeles out rebounded the Pelicans, but the 25 turnovers compared to the 13 on New Orleans was instrumental. DeMarcus Cousins, Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday were too much for the Lakers to handle in the long run, and the defensive effort in the third quarter holding the Lakers to just 14 points was key. Cousins finished with 26 points, 15 rebounds and two assists across 31 minutes, while Davis posted 31 points on 10 - of - 22 shooting. Davis added nine rebounds and two assists and led all scorers in the contest. Jrue Holiday scored 20 points, to go with 12 assists and five boards. Brandon Ingram scored 16 points, alongside six rebounds and two assists, while Nick Young buried four three - pointers on his way to 19 points. Table format: <NEWLINE>  There are 2 tables.

After starting the season 0 - 17, Philadelphia has played much better of late and has gone 10 - 20 over its last 30 games. While its record in that span may not jump off the page, the emergence of its young players has been encouraging. Michael Carter-Williams had his third triple - double of the season Friday, putting up 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. Carter-Williams is now tied with Rajon Rondo for the league lead in triple - doubles. In addition, the 76ers had 16 fast break points, compared to just five such points for the Timberwolves. Minnesota was unable to close the gap late with some poor shooting and a poor defensive effort. There were some bright spots for the Timberwolves, however. Kevin Martin, in his second game back from a wrist injury, had 19 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench. Nikola Pekovic looked strong as well, putting up 18 points and seven rebounds. The Timberwolves will play the second half of a back - to - back set Saturday when they host the Cavaliers. Philadelphia scored over 100 points for the first time since a Dec. 13 overtime loss to Memphis. Nerlens Noel continued to be a defensive force Friday, recording six blocks to go along with 14 points and six rebounds. Friday's win was just the third time this season Philadelphia has strung together consecutive wins. Philadelphia will wrap up its back - to - back set Saturday in Atlanta.

All five Nuggets (12 - 16) starters finished in double figures scoring, led by Nikola Jokic and his 27 points.

Jamal Murray saw 14 minutes of action after dealing with soreness, but only contributed three points on four shots. The injuries have derailed the season for the Mavericks, who will struggle to compete with even the mid - level opponents. The road struggle continues for Dallas as well, who have just one road win on the year. Deron Williams led the team with 23 points, to go along with rebound and eight assists. Harrison Barnes also contributed an efficient effort with 19 points on 9 - of - 15 shooting. Impressively, both teams shot above 50 percent as a unit, but the strong 53 percent effort from the Mavericks was overshadowed by the even more powerful 57 percent effort from the Nuggets. The Nuggets play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday, while the Mavericks visit the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

While there were a lot of stars in this game, it's some of the undervalued players who had career nights. Both Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers led their teams in scoring, as these are two teams that desperately need more contributions from their role players. Shooting was the difference for the Clippers, as they shot 50 percent from both the field and from the free - throw line. Despite this game being close throughout, the Clippers led for every minute after the first quarter. In fact, neither team held a double - digit lead, as there were just seven ties and four lead changes. Los Angeles (19 - 7) is starting to recapture their early season form and road wins like this only add to their impressive resume '. Austin Rivers was the star, as he scored a team - high 25 points on 9 - of - 12 shooting. Blake Griffin was n't far behind, as he tallied 23 points, seven rebounds and three assists. DeAndre Jordan had one of his best scoring games of the year, totaling 22 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks, while going 12 - of - 18 from the free - throw line. Chris Paul recorded a 16 - point, 10 - assist double - double. Los Angeles will return to action on Friday in a road matchup against the Miami Heat. Orlando (11 - 16) has now lost six - straight games at home, as they continue to disappoint. Aaron Gordon did all he could though, dropping a career - high 33 points on 13 - of - 21 shooting. Evan Fournier accumulated 23 points and eight assists as the primary ball - handler for Orlando. Jeff Green was the only other Magic player in double figures, as he scored 19 points off the bench. Serge Ibaka and Bismack Biyombo both fell just shy of double - doubles, as they combined for 17 points and 20 rebounds in the defeat. Orlando's next game will be on Friday, when they host the Brooklyn Nets. Table format: There are two tables. The first table has four columns and three rows.

Houston took a 12 - point lead at the end of the first quarter and simply expanded on it, all the way up to as much as 30 points late in the second half. Philadelphia only managed eight points from halfway through the third quarter to the end of that period, which put the game completely out of reach. The bright spot for the 76ers continues to come from Joel Embiid, who played well over his 23 minutes, save for the six turnovers during that span. Embiid went on to score 13 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, blocked two shots and added one steal on 6 - of - 10 shooting. Harden led the way for Houston with 33 points, nine assists and seven rebounds on 12 - of - 20 shooting, including four three - pointers.

Despite being out - scored 62 - 56 in the first half, the Grizzlies came out hot in the third quarter and scored 19 more points than the Mavericks, setting them up for the victory in front of their home crowd. Memphis was able to use their superior shooting to give them the advantage, which was just enough to secure the win. The Grizzlies were led by the duo of Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. Gasol had a game - high of 30 points (9 - 14 FG), while also contributing six assists and five rebounds. He was able to get to the free throw line a wopping 13 times, and converted on 12 out of those attempts. Conley on the other hand shot 9 - for - 13 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 22 points. He continued to shoot well after not missing a shot on Sunday against the Miami Heat. He's now averaging 17 points and 6 assists per game. Zach Randolph also had a big impact and scored 17 points (6 - 18 FG, 5 - 6 FT), to go along with 13 rebounds. It marked his twelth double - double of the year. Both Tayshaun Prince and Beno Udrih reached double figures off the bench with 11 and 10 points respectively. Chandler Parsons continued his hot shooting for the Mavericks. He went 10 - for - 18 from the field and 6 - for - 10 from beyond the arc to score a team - high of 30 points, while also grabbing seven rebounds. He's now combined for 58 points and 12 rebounds in the last two games, as he continued with his offensive momentum. Jameer Nelson also had a nice game from the floor, shooting 6 - for - 9 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 18 points. Nelson had scored a combined seven points over his last two outings, so he was due for a breakout game. Monta Ellis had been on fire over the last week or so, but really struggled with his shot against the Grizzlies and finished with only two points (1 - 11 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt). Both Jae Crowder and Jose Barea had decent games off the bench with 13 and 17 points apiece. The Grizzlies' next game will be at home against the Charlotte Hornets on Friday, while the Mavericks will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday. Table format: There are two tables in the text.   The first table has 5 columns and 3 rows. The column names are \"Team\", \"Number of team assists\", \"Losses\", \"Total points\", and \"Wins\". The row names are \"Grizzlies\", \"Mavericks\", and \"Player\".   The second table has 14 columns and 10 rows. The column names are \"Assists\", \"3-pointers attempted\", \"3-pointers made\", \"Field goals attempted\", \"Field goals made\", \"Free throws attempted\", \"Free throws made\", \"Personal fouls\", \"Points\", \"Total rebounds\", \"Steals\", and \"Jae Crowder\". The row names are \"Chandler Parsons\", \"Monta Ellis\", \"Jameer Nelson\", \"Jae Crowder\", \"J.J. Barea\", \"Zach Randolph\", \"Marc Gasol\", \"Mike Conley\", \"Tayshaun Prince\", and \"Beno Udrih\".",

        "input": "Input text: The New Orleans Pelicans (26 - 22) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (40 - 9) 115 - 110 on Monday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. Looking to extend their winning streak to 20 games Monday, the Hawks came out of this game dissapointed, as the Pelicans stepped up and took an impressive 15 - point victory. The Pelicans shot pretty well, going 50 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three - point line, while the Hawks went 45 percent from the floor and 32 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans were also able to finish with a 52 - 32 rebounding advantage, giving them a huge upperhand and contributing even further to the win. As he's done all season long, Anthony Davis continued to show himself as one of the best players in the league. In 34 minutes, he finished with 29 points (12 - 23 FG, 5 - 7 FT), 13 rebounds and and two blocked shots. It was his fifth double - double in a row, a stretch where he's averaged 27 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks per game. Eric Gordon had a really strong showing as well, going 7 - for - 11 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 20 points, while also adding seven assists in 28 minutes. It was his second impressive game in a row, as he's combined for 48 points and 14 assists over those two matchups. Recording a double - double of his own, Tyreke Evans added 15 points (7 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), five rebounds and 12 assists. He's recorded exactly 12 assists in four out of his last five games. The Pelicans had a huge effort off the bench as well. Ryan Anderson recorded 15 points (5 - 10 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and six rebounds, while Jimmer Fredette added 10 points (3 - 6 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three assists. The Hawks saw their biggest contribution from Jeff Teague, who had a team - high of 21 points (8 - 17 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT), while also adding seven assists. He had an ugly showing in Saturday's game against Philadelphia, where he went just 3 - of - 12 from the field, so it was good to see him hit his shot more consistently Monday. Paul Millsap also did as much as he could to keep the Hawks alive, finishing with 15 points (5 - 14 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), six rebounds and two blocked shots. He's now averaging 17 points and eight rebounds per game so far this season. Kent Bazemore continued to start at small forward with DeMare Carroll playing limited action off the bench due to general soreness in his body. Bazemore finished with nine points (4 - 9 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 1 - 3 FT) and three rebounds in 26 minutes. Both Kyle Korver and Dennis Schroder reached double figures as well, scoring 12 and 10 points respectively. The Pelicans' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, while the Hawks will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday.

Philadelphia (8 - 24) saw strong big man play in Friday's win, with rookie center Joel Embiid taking the reigns. Embiid led the team with 23 points and also had six rebounds, five assists, two steals, and three blocks. Despite playing on limited minutes due to a foot injury that robbed him of two full seasons of play, Embiid is the runaway favorite for Rookie of the Year this season. Forward Ersan Ilyasova also scored 23 and recorded a team - high 13 rebounds. Philly was able to get the edge in the game with stellar shooting from long range, knocking down 16 three - pointers on the night. Denver (14 - 19) was also led by its young standout center. Sophomore Nikola Jokic scored 25 points to go with seven rebounds and four assists. Jokic has led all centers in assists since being moved into the starting lineup. Sophomore point guard Emmanuel Mudiay, meanwhile, had a rare night of offensive efficiency, scoring 22 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting. The Nuggets as a whole shot over 47 percent from the field, but could not find the three - point shooting to match Philly. Both teams will enjoy a few days of rest carrying into the New Year.

Both the reigning NBA champs and the newly - minted, two - time MVP rediscovered their elite form just in time to prevent elimination. The Warriors were staring at the very real possibility of a premature end to their season with 8 left in the fourth quarter, as they were on the short end of an 89 - 81 deficit. However, the vaunted Splash Brothers simply would not be denied a Game 7 at home, as they combined to drain 17 of 31 three - point attempts, including multiple off - balance shots in the final minutes. Klay Thompson set a new playoff record in the process with 11 treys, and Stephen Curry was just an assist shy of a triple - double in what was his most complete game of the series. Long-range shooting was certainly a key overall to the comeback victory, as the Warriors outperformed the Thunder from beyond the arc by a margin of 48 percent to 13 percent. Thompson led all scorers with 41 points, and he added four rebounds, a steal and a block. Curry was next with 31 points, 10 rebounds, nine assists and a pair of steals. Draymond Green supplied a double - double of his own, registering 12 points, 12 boards, six assists, three steals and a block. Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut were n't called on to do too much offensively with the top three options so heavily involved, but did combine for 14 points. Andre Iguodala paced the reserves with eight points, seven boards, an assist and three steals. The Thunder were led by Kevin Durant's 29 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, three assists, three blocks and a pair of steals. Russell Westbrook was right behind him with 28 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds and four thefts. Serge Ibaka turned in another solid effort down low, tallying 13 points, nine rebounds and three blocks. Andre Roberson was in double digits once again, collecting 11 points, eight rebounds, three blocks and a steal. Steven Adams posted a near double - double with nine points and nine boards, and he also had an assist and a steal. Enes Kanter led the second unit with eight points, three rebounds and a block.

        "input": "Input text: The Washington Wizards (31 - 15) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (12 - 34) 98 - 92 on Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Coming into halftime, the Lakers had taken a 57 - 46 lead and were playing quite well against a tough opponent. The Wizards exploded in the second half though, out - scoring the Lakers 52 - 35 over that span, giving the Wizards a six - point victory on the road. The Wizards were the better shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field, while the Lakers shot just 43 percent. The Wizards also secured a huge 51 - 38 rebounding advantage, helping push them to a win. The Wizards' backcourt of John Wall and Bradley Beal did most of the damage to the Lakers. Wall came one rebound shy of a triple - double, finishing with 21 points (8 - 12 FG, 5 - 12 FT), nine rebounds, 13 assists and three steals. It was his second straight double - double, as he's combined for 39 points and 29 assists over his last two games. Beal on the other hand recorded 19 points (9 - 18 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt), four rebounds and two assists. He had a poor display from the three - point line, but still finished well over his 15 points per game scoring average. With Paul Pierce sitting this game out, Otto Porter moved into the starting lineup and had a very productive game. He went 5 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 12 points in 29 minutes. Marcin Gortat reached double figures as well with 11 points (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 1 FT) and seven rebounds of his own. The Lakers were led by Wayne Ellington, who scored a season - high as he continued to replace Kobe Bryant in the starting lineup. Ellington finished with a game - high of 28 points (12 - 20 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), while also adding three assists and three steals. The steals were also a season - high for him, as it was easily his best showing of the year. He's now recorded double figures in four straight games, despite averaging only 8 points on the year. Rookie Jordan Clarkson had himself a day as well with the starting lineup. He recorded a season - high of 18 points (8 - 18 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), to go along with three rebounds and three assists. The Lakers just did n't get help from any of their other starters, who combined for only 15 points. The only other Laker to reach double - digit points was Ed Davis, who came off the bench for 14 points (6 - 7 FG, 2 - 2 FT). The Wizards' next game will be on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday.

        "input": "Input text: The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Toronto Raptors, 116 - 78, on Wednesday night at Quicken Loans Arena to take a 3 - 2 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. Likely a bit spooked by both their performance over the last two games, and the throttling suffered by the other postseason presumptive favorite down in Oklahoma City in their last pair of contests, the Cavaliers came out with impressive tunnel vision in Game 5. They ambushed the visiting Raptors right out of the gate, winning the first quarter by a margin of 37 - 19. The rout was on, as Cleveland took a massive 65 - 34 advantage into halftime, a lead that eventually ballooned to 100 - 60 by the end of the third period. A major difference Wednesday night was the return to prominence of Kevin Love, who'd shot 5 - for - 23 over the previous two games. Love exploded for a game - high 25 points, and supplemented the scoring with two assists, two rebounds, two blocks and a steal. As the final score would indicate, the Cavs outclassed Toronto in every offensive category. They shot 57 percent from the field while holding their guests to a 39 percent figure, and drained 48 percent of their three - point attempts while limiting the Raptors to a 18 percent success rate from beyond the arc. The domination continued down low, where they outrebounded Toronto by a 48 - 27 margin and outscored them in the paint, 46 - 32. The Raptors were led by DeMar DeRozan, who compiled 14 points, three rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. Kyle Lowry followed with 13 points, six assists, three rebounds and a steal. Bismack Biyombo was held in check, as he supplied a modest seven points, four rebounds and a block. DeMarre Carroll and Luis Scola, the other two members of the starting five, could only combine to supply 12 points. One bright spot for Toronto in the lopsided loss was Jonas Valanciunas' return, as he collected nine points and an assist in just over 18 minutes on the court to lead the second unit. LeBron James was second to Love on Cleveland with a 23 - point tally, which he complemented with eight assists, six rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. Kyrie Irving was next with 23 points, and he added three rebounds, three assists, three steals and a block. Tristan Thompson provided a near double - double with nine points, 10 boards, a steal and a block. Reggie Jefferson paced the reserves with 11 points, six rebounds and an assist in 20 minutes. With the comfortable margin of victory, the Cavs were able to give their first unit plenty of rest, as James' 31 minutes served as the highest allotment of playing time among the starters. The series returns to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto for Game 6 on Friday night, as the Raptors will try to stave off elimination. Table format: <NEWLINE>  There are two tables.

New York came in handicapped down low, as Joakim Noah missed the game with an illness, but the duo of Kyle O'Quinn and Willy Hernangomez combined for 15 points and 15 rebounds, helping to make up for his absence. The Knicks were also able to post a solid 48 percent success rate from the field overall while limiting the Hawks to just 40 percent shooting. Atlanta was led by Paul Millsap's 19 points, which he complemented with seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. Dwight Howard turned in another monster effort with 18 points, 18 boards and two blocks. Kyle Korver equaled a season - high with 17 points, and added four rebounds, an assist and two steals.

        "input": "Input text: The Miami Heat (34 - 26) defeated the Chicago Bulls (30 - 29) 129 - 111 on Tuesday. It's often said that a change of scenery can do wonders for a player's outlook and consequently, his performance. Such appears to be the case with Miami's latest acquisition, 15 - year veteran Joe Johnson. In just his second game in a Heat uniform, Johnson paced the starting unit with 24 points, and added five rebounds, four assists and a block, his second performance of 20 points or more in two games in South Florida. He was an integral part of a historic shooting performance for the home squad, which tallied a 68 percent success rate from the field, including 50 percent from beyond the arc. Not only was it the top team shooting night to date in the 2015 - 16 campaign, but also the 17th - best such effort in the last 50 seasons. The 129 points also represented Miami's highest scoring tally of the season. Lost in the Heat's offense's coming - out party was a pretty fair showing on the scoreboard by the Bulls. Seven Chicago players - - four starters and three reserves - - managed double - digit scoring, led by Derrick Rose's 17 points. He added three assists and a steal, in his first game back from the hamstring ailment that had caused him to miss the three previous contests. Aaron Brooks followed with a 16 - point performance that paced the Bulls' bench, and that also included a pair of rebounds and an assist. Pau Gasol was next with a near double - double, registering 15 points, nine boards, six assists and a block. Taj Gibson supplied 13 points, three rebounds, an assist and a steal, while Mike Dunleavy amassed 10 points, two rebounds and an assist. Bobby Portis and Doug McDermott were the other two reserves with double - digit scoring, as they each contributed 11 points. The former also brought down seven boards and recored four steals, while the latter complemented his scoring total with a rebound, an assist and a steal. The Bulls are in third place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division, and dropped a half - game back of the now eighth - seeded Detroit Pistons with the loss. They head up the road to Orlando for an encounter with the Magic on Wednesday night. With such a prolific showing, the Heat naturally had plenty to be pleased about on the stat sheet. Hassan Whiteside continued to show that perhaps coming off the bench is what best suits him, as he once again paced Miami with a 26 - point, 14 - rebound effort that also included an assist and four blocks. It was notably the sixth straight double - double in his six post - All - Star - break games, all in a reserve role. Johnson was next with his aforementioned 24 - point haul, and he also posted five rebounds, four assists and a block. Luol Deng continued his solid stretch of play, totaling 20 points, four rebounds, two assists and a steal. Dwyane Wade was next in line with 18 points, seven assists and a pair of rebounds, and Goran Dragic was right behind with a 17 - point, 11 - assist double - double that was supplemented with four boards and a steal. Miami sits atop the Eastern Conference's Southeastern Division, and currently has a hold on the fourth seed in the conference as well. They remain home to face the Phoenix Suns on Thursday.

The Sixers (21 - 34) are clearly an improved team this season, and Monday's game was a tangible example of such. In past seasons, even a Philadelphia squad at full strength would have found a win on the road a near impossibility. Take out two key players and a 30 - to - 40 - point defeat was a very real possibility. However, this season's unit is playing with a very different level of confidence, and that intangible was pivotal to the Sixers notching a hard - fought victory despite the absences of Joel Embiid (knee) and Jahlil Okafor (coach's decision). Six players managed double digits in the scoring column, and Philadelphia shot 48 percent from the field overall. They played strong defense as well, limiting the Hornets (24 - 31) to a 44 percent success rate from the field and 36 percent from three - point range. Dario Saric led the visitors overall with 18 points off the bench, which he supplemented with 11 boards, three assists and one block. Robert Covington tallied 17 points, five rebounds, two assists, three steals and one block. T.J. McConnell supplied 14 points, seven assists, four rebounds and one steal. Gerald Henderson and Nerlens Noel provided matching 12 - point efforts, with the former adding four boards and one assist, and the latter registering seven boards, one assist, three steals and two blocks. Nik Stauskas generated 11 points, six rebounds, two assists and one steal. Kemba Walker paced the Hornets with a game - high 29 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Nicolas Batum compiled 16 points, four assists, one rebound and two steals. Frank Kaminsky III posted a 12 - point, 11 - rebound double - double that also included two assists, three blocks and one steal. Jeremy Lamb led the second unit with 12 points and one steal. Marco Belinelli and Brian Roberts were productive as well with matching eight - point efforts. The Sixers travel to Beantown for a Wednesday night date with the Boston Celtics, while the Hornets travel north of the border to tangle with the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday evening as well.

The Heat did most of their damage in the first half, out - scoring the Celitcs 52 - 42. They were able to finish the game shooting 47 percent from the field and 29 percent from the three - point line, while the Celtics shot 40 percent from the floor and 26 percent from beyond the arc. The Heat were able to force the Celitcs into 15 turnovers, giving them an even greater advantage to take home the victory. The Heat had six players reach double figures in points in this one. Luol Deng led all scorers with 23 points, after shooting 9 - for - 15 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line. He also went a perfect 4 - of - 4 from the free throw line. With Dwyane Wade sitting out, Mario Chalmers got pushed into the starting lineup, where he took advantage of the extra playing time and recorded his fourth double - double of the season with 11 points (5 - 13 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 4 FT) and 10 assists. Although it was n't his best day shooting from the floor, he still made up for it with the opportunities he gave to his teammates. Norris Cole also benefitted from some extra playing time and scored 15 points in 37 minutes. The fifteen points were the most he's had since scoring 23 points in the season opener and the minutes played was near a season - high. James Ennis also provided a big boost off the bench with 16 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and eight rebounds. It was a season - high in points for him as he has only reached double figures in points once before. The Celtics struggled to find any consistent offense in their young lineup. Tyler Zeller did most of the damage for them as he went 10 - for - 15 from the floor and 2 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 22 points, while also grabbing eight rebounds. It was only the second time Zeller has broken the 20 - point mark this season. Both Jeff Green and Kelly Olynyk chipped in 13 points of there own, but without much contribution from the bench, the Celtics came up a quite a bit short.

All-Star James Harden led the game with 41 points and added nine assists. Harden's scoring outburst came at just the right time for Houston, as the Rockets remain half a game out of the Western Conference playoffs. The team went on a massive 15 - 2 run in the fourth quarter, leading to a comeback over the powerhouse Thunder. Solid defense on OKC's superstar duo of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook helped to get the job done, as the pair turned the ball over a combined 14 times. Also coming up big for the Rockets was bench big man Clint Capela, who delivered four huge blocks as well as a pair of steals. For the Thunder, Sunday marks the team's 13th loss after leading headed into the fourth quarter, the most in the league. Turnovers seemed to be the death of the team on Sunday, as the ball was coughed up 19 times all in all. Despite the loss, point guard Russell Westbrook tallied his 51st double - double of the season and was just one assist shy of a league - leading 17th triple double. Elite scorer Kevin Durant also chipped in 33 points on the night. The Thunder will visit Denver on Tuesday, while the Rockets will visit rival Dallas on Wednesday.

Paul George struggled for most of Monday's contest, but when the Pacers (36 - 34) needed him the most, the All-Star came though. With just 20 seconds remaining in the contest and his team up three, George let the clock wind down before pulling up from just behind the foul line. The jumper was good, and George's shot gave the Pacers their fifth straight home victory. George finished with 19 points on a poor 6 - of - 20 shooting from the field, but that sixth made field goal was all Indiana needed. Jeff Teague ended up leading the way offensive for the team, scoring a team - high 21 points to go along with 5 rebounds and five assists. As for the Jazz (43 - 28), they got a heroic performance from their own All-Star, Gordon Hayward, as he put up a career - high 38 points on 16 - of - 24 shooting from the field, but in the end, it just was n't enough. That was thanks in large part to the lack of depth Utah showed Monday night, as the seven reserves that saw for the floor for the Jazz combined to score just 17 points while four of the five starters scored in double figures. The Jazz have now lost three straight games to end their road trip out east, but they still sit 2 games ahead of the Clippers for the No. 4 seed. Up next, the Pacers will head to Boston on Wednesday to take on the Celtics, while the Jazz will head home Wednesday to take on the Knicks.

By out - scoring the Lakers 32 - 22 in the second quarter, the Suns were able give themselves a big enough lead to allow some wiggle room in the second half so they could seal the victory. Coming off the bench, Gerald Green took the reins for the Suns and pitched in 26 points, shooting 11 - for - 19 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line. This was a season - high for Green even though he only got 23 minutes of playing time. Markieff Morris had his second double - double of the year. He scored 23 points for the Suns, while also grabbing a team - high 10 rebounds. Isaiah Thomas chipped in 22 points of his own off the bench, as he shot 8 - for - 16 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from behind the three - point line. He has now scored over 20 points in three of the Suns' four games this season and has given the Suns a consistent option off the bench. Goran Dragic was also able to score in double - digits, putting up 16 points with seven rebounds. Kobe Bryant led the Lakers with 39 points, and he grabbed nine rebounds. Bryant shot 37 times, converting 14 of them, while also going 3 - for - 7 from beyond the arc. Jordan Hill recorded his first double - double of the season, scoring 11 points and grabbing 12 rebounds as the starting center. Jeremy Lin, who's struggled to begin the season, finally found his shot and went 4 - for - 8 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from three - point land to score 18 points. Ryan Kelly (hamstring) made his season debut and finished with two points on 1 - of - 2 shooting.

        "input": "Input text: The San Antonio Spurs (12 - 3) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (9 - 7) 88 - 83 on Wednesday at the AT & T Center in San Antonio. In a tight battle between two of the more experienced teams in the league, the Spurs were able to hold on in the fourth quarter to secure the five - point victory in front of their home crowd. The Spurs shot 41 percent from the field and 29 percent from the three - point line, while the Mavericks finished at 41 percent from the field and 27 percent from deep. While the majority of the outing had the two teams interlocked, the Spurs were able to secure a 52 - 46 rebounding advantage, which may have been just enough to pull out the victory. The Spurs leaned on Kawhi Leonard again in this one. He came in the clutch, scoring five of the Spurs' final six points, all within the last minute of the fourth quarter. Including the final five, Leonard recorded a game - high of 26 points (9 - 16 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), while also adding eight rebounds, five assists and two steals. Despite being questionable coming into Wednesday's contest, LaMarcus Aldridge still performed at a high level, scoring 18 points (8 - 17 FG, 2 - 3 FT), to go along with seven rebounds and a blocked shot. Aldridge sat out the last two games with an ankle injury, so it was good to see the ninth - year forward finish the game without any setbacks. Tony Parker was the only other Spurs' player in double figures, chipping in with 16 points on 7 - of - 11 shots from the field. He also added eight rebounds and eight assists, coming just shy of his first triple - double of the season. Parker is averaging 14 points, 5 assists and 2 rebounds on the year. Despite taking the loss, Dirk Nowitzki continued his strong play. He went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 0 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 13 points, to go along with 14 rebounds and a pair of assists. At 37 years old, the 17 - year veteran out of Germany has already recorded three double - doubles on the season. Wesley Matthews was the only other starter to find some success for the Mavericks. He finished with a team - high of 15 points (6 - 16 FG, 3 - 10 3Pt), while also adding four rebounds over 36 minutes. Matthews has really struggled with his shot this season, averaging a career - low 35 percent from the field and just 33 percent from the three - point line, so after Wednesday's outing, it appears he still has n't been able to make any noticeable improvements. Coming off the bench, Devin Harris posted 11 points (4 - 5 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT) and three rebounds before fouling out. The Spurs' next game will be on the road in Denver against the Nuggets on Friday, while the Mavericks will be at home against the Denver Nuggets on Saturday. Table format: <NEWLINE>  Two tables.

The Grizzlies came into this game with a 7 - 2 road record, and look like a serious contender. The Rockets were looking to spoil that, and did so while making life tough from the outside for the Grizzlies. Memphis only saw three players score in double figures\\, but nine players scored at least seven points. Mike Conley led the way with 15 points (5 - 9 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), six assists and three steals in 27 minutes. Both Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol had quiet nights, as both had eight points and managed just 13 total rebounds between the two. What made this win even more impressive for the Rockets, was the fact that they got it done without Dwight Howard. Howard was out with a strained right knee, but six players stepped up to score in double figures during his absence. James Harden led the way, scoring 21 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) to go with four assists, four rebounds, three steals and one block in 28 minutes. Tarik Black, who started in place of Howard, posted a double - double with 10 points (5 - 9 FG), with 11 rebounds. It was an impressive, well - rounded effort from Houston.

        "input": "Input text: The Oklahoma City Thunder (11 - 6) defeated the Detroit Pistons (8 - 8) 103 - 87 on Friday. This was the Reggie Jackson homecoming game, but he did n't have his best performance. In fact, both point guards struggled mightily. Jackson battled foul trouble all game long while shooting just 4 - for - 16 from the field. Westbrook was even worse, as he tallied just 14 points, four rebounds and four assists while committing a ghastly 11 turnovers. These were the top - two rebounding teams in the NBA coming in and that proved to be the difference. The Thunder actually outrebounded the Pistons 58 - 38 and simply dominated the boards. The Pistons are usually carried by Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond, but they were both battling foul trouble all game long. That's a recipe for disaster and they could n't quite bounce - back with that adversity. They still managed to combine for 30 points and 12 rebounds but that was n't enough. In fact, those seven rebounds from Drummond marks the first time he has n't cracked double - digits this season. The Pistons also did n't get much bench production, as only four players came off the bench with none of them scoring more than six points. If Drummond and Jackson are going to battle foul problems and the bench does n't step up, a win is a nearly impossible proposition. Detroit will take on the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday in their next scheduled game. The Thunder got a win, despite Westbrook's worst game of the season. The defense was the key, as they held the Pistons to just 32 points in the second half. Oklahoma City was also happy to see Kevin Durant at full strength and playing at an MVP level in this game. Durant dropped 34 points, 13 rebounds, five assists and three blocks in the win. Those are the types of performances the Thunder need from Durant all season if they are to compete for an NBA title. That is the beauty of having Durant and Westbrook. If one is off, the other can go crazy and carry the team on any given night. Oklahoma City will have a tough matchup in their next game, as they travel to Atlanta to take on the Hawks on Monday. Table format: There are two tables.   The first table has 5 columns and 3 rows. The column names are: \"Team\", \"Losses\", \"Total points\", \"Rebounds\", and \"Wins\". The row names are: \"Thunder\", \"Pistons\", and \"\".   The second table has 9 columns and 4 rows.
