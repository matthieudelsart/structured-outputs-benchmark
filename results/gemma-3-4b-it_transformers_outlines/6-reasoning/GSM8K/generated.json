If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?",
        "output": {
            "reasoning": "There are 5 total ounces of water because 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5\nThe total temperatures is >=200 because 200 / 5 =<<200/5=40>>40\nThe 33 degree water contributes 132 points towards this because 4 x 33 = <<4*33=132>>132\nThe unknown temperature is at least 68 because 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68",

        "generated_output": "{\"reasoning\": \"Let $x$ be the temperature of the second mug. Donny pours 4 ounces of 33 degrees water into his water bottle. Then he pours 1 ounce of $x$ degrees water into his water bottle. The total volume in his water bottle is $4+1 = 5$ ounces. The temperature of the water in the bottle is $\\\\frac{4(33) + 1(x)}{5} = \\\\frac{132 + x}{5}$. Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees, so $\\\\frac{132 + x}{5} \\\\\\\\\\\\geq 40$. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $132 + x \\\\\\\\\\\\geq 200$. Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get $x \\\\\\\\\\\\geq 200 - 132 = 68$. Thus, the temperature of the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees. \\\".\\\",\" ,\"answer\": 68}"
