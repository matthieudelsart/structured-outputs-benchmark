2025-06-22 22:23:24,528 [WARNING] Invalid JSON string: ```json
{"reasoning": "Let $x$ be the temperature of the second mug. Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water into his bottle and 1 ounce of $x$-degree water into his bottle. The total volume is $4+1=5$ ounces. The temperature of the mixture is such that Donny can drink it. This means the temperature must be at least 40 degrees. The amount of heat in the 4 ounces of 33-degree water is $4 \times 33 = 132$ degree-ounces. The amount of heat in the 1 ounce of $x$-degree water is $1 \times x = x$ degree-ounces. The total heat is $132 + x$ degree-ounces. The total volume is 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixture is $\frac{132+x}{5}$. We want this temperature to be at least 40 degrees, so $\frac{132+x}{5} \ge 40$. Multiplying by 5, we get $132+x \ge 200$. Subtracting 132, we get $x \ge 200 - 132 = 68$. Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.", "answer": 68}
