{"reasoning": "The well is 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay. Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet/hour through soil and 2 feet/hour through clay. To find the total time, we need to determine how much time is spent digging through soil and how much time is spent digging through clay. The time spent digging through soil is 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours. The time spent digging through clay is 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours. Therefore, the total time is 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours. However, we need to consider that he digs through clay at a slower rate. The time spent digging through clay is 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours. The total time is 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours. The total time is 10 hours. The total time is 10 hours.

{"reasoning": "The problem states that they unrolled as many fruit roll-ups as they could find. The width and length of each roll-up are given for Marcell and Beatrice. We need to find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate. To find the average, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by the number of people.  Marcell ate 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so he ate 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups. Beatrice ate 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so she ate 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. The total number of roll-ups eaten is 42 + 48 = 90. The number of people is 2. Therefore, the average is 90 / 2 = 45.

{"reasoning": "Let the age of the first twin be $t$, the age of the first triplet be $s$, and the age of the second twin be $t'$. We are given that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This means $t' = s + 7$. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. So, $t + s + t' = 44$. Substituting $t' = s + 7$, we get $t + s + (s + 7) = 44$, which simplifies to $t + 2s + 7 = 44$. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get $t + 2s = 37$. We are given that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. We are not given any information about the ages of the triplets. However, we are asked to find the age of one of the twins. We can express $t$ in terms of $s$: $t = 37 - 2s$. Since $t$ is the age of a twin, it must be a positive integer. Also, $s$ is the age of a triplet, so it must be a positive integer.
We are given that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's assume that the triplets are of the same age. Then $s = t'$. So, $t + 2t' = 37$. We are given that the twins are 7 years older than the triplets. Let $t$ be the age of the first twin and $s$ be the age of the first triplet. Then $t = s + 7$. The combined ages are $t + s + t' = 44$. Substituting $t = s + 7$, we get $(s + 7) + s + t' = 44$, which simplifies to $2s + 7 + t' = 44$. Thus, $2s + t' = 37$.
Since $t = s + 7$, we have $t' = s + 7$. We are given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.
Let's consider the case where the triplets have the same age as the twins. Then $s = t'$. So, $t + 2s = 37$. We are looking for $t$.
We have $t = 37 - 2s$. Since $t$ is an age, it must be a positive integer. Also, $s$ is an age, so it must be a positive integer.
If $s = 1$, then $t = 37 - 2(1) = 35$. The age of the twins is 35.
If $s = 2$, then $t = 37 - 2(2) = 33$. The age of the twins is 33.
If $s = 3$, then $t = 37 - 2(3) = 31$. The age of the twins is 31.
...
If $s = 13$, then $t = 37 - 2(13) = 37 - 26 = 11$. The age of the twins is 11.
If $s = 14$, then $t = 37 - 2(14) = 37 - 28 = 9$. The age of the twins is 9.
If $s = 15$, then $t = 37 - 2(15) = 37 - 30 = 7$. The age of the twins is 7.
If $s = 16$, then $t = 37 - 2(16) = 37 - 32 = 5$. The age of the twins is 5.
If $s = 17$, then $t = 37 - 2(17) = 37 - 34 = 3$. The age of the twins is 3.
If $s = 18$, then $t = 37 - 2(18) = 37 - 36 = 1$. The age of the twins is 1.

However, we are given that the twins are 7 years older than the triplets.
Let $t$ be the age of the first twin and $s$ be the age of the first triplet. Then $t = s + 7$.
The combined ages are $t + s + t' = 44$. Substituting $t = s + 7$, we get $(s + 7) + s + t' = 44$, so $2s + 7 + t' = 44$, which means $2s + t' = 37$.
We are looking for $t$. We have $t = s + 7$.
We need to find $s$.
Let's consider the case where the triplets are the same age as the twins. Then $s = t'$. So $2s + t' = 37$.
If $s = 1$, then $t' = 1$. $t = s + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8$. $t + s + t' = 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 \neq 44$.
If $s = 2$, then $t' = 2$. $t = s + 7 = 2 + 7 = 9$. $t + s + t' = 9 + 2 + 2 = 13 \neq 44$.
If $s = 3$, then $t' = 3$. $t = s + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10$. $t + s + t' = 10 + 3 + 3 = 16 \neq 44$.
If $s = 4$, then $t' = 4$. $t = s + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11$. $t + s + t' = 11 + 4 + 4 = 19 \neq 44$.
If $s = 5$, then $t' = 5$. $t = s + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12$. $t + s + t' = 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 \neq 44$.
If $s = 6$, then $t' = 6$. $t = s + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13$. $t + s + t' = 13 + 6 + 6 = 25 \neq 44$.
If $s = 7$, then $t' = 7$. $t = s + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14$. $t + s + t' = 14 + 7 + 7 = 28 \neq 44$.
If $s = 8$, then $t' = 8$. $t = s + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15$. $t + s + t' = 15 + 8 + 8 = 31 \neq 44$.
If $s = 9$, then $t' = 9$. $t = s + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16$. $t + s + t' = 16 + 9 + 9 = 34 \neq 44$.
If $s = 10$, then $t' = 10$. $t = s + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17$. $t + s + t' = 17 + 10 + 10 = 37 \neq 44$.
If $s = 11$, then $t' = 11$. $t = s + 7 = 11 + 7 = 18$. $t + s + t' = 18 + 11 + 11 = 40 \neq 44$.
If $s = 12$, then $t' = 12$. $t = s + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19$. $t + s + t' = 19 + 12 + 12 = 43 \neq 44$.
If $s = 13$, then $t' = 13$. $t = s + 7 = 13 + 7 = 20$. $t + s + t' = 20 + 13 + 13 = 46 \neq 44$.

Let $t = 16$. Then $s = 9$. $t + s + t' = 16 + 9 + t' = 44$, so $t' = 44 - 16 - 9 = 44 - 25 = 19$.
$t = s + 7$, so $16 = 9 + 7$, which is $16 = 16$.
Thus, $t = 16$ is a possible solution.

{"reasoning": "First, calculate the cost of the bacon packs: 5 packs * $10/pack = $50. Next, calculate the cost of the chicken packs: 6 packets * 2 * $10/packet = $120. Then, calculate the cost of the strawberries: 3 packs * $4/pack = $12. Finally, calculate the cost of the apples: 7 packs / 2 = 3.5 packs.  The total cost of the strawberries and apples is $12 + 3.5 * $4 = $12 + $14 = $26.  Subtract the cost of the bacon, chicken, and strawberry packs from the budget: $65 - $50 - $12 - $26 = $65 - $88 = -$23.  However, the budget is $65, so we need to re-evaluate. The budget is $65. The cost of bacon is $50. The cost of chicken is $120. The cost of strawberries is $12. The cost of apples is $3.5 * $4 = $14. The total cost is $50 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $196.  Since the budget is $65, the remaining money is $65 - $196 = -$131.  This is not possible, so let's re-examine the problem. The budget is $65. The cost of bacon is $50. The cost of chicken is $120.

The total cost of the items is $50 + $120 + $12 + $3.5 * $4 = $50 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $196. Kelly's budget is $65. The remaining money is $65 - $196 = -$131. This is not possible.

The problem is incorrect. Let's try again. Kelly has $65. She has $50 for bacon. She has $120 for chicken. She has $12 for strawberries. She has $3.5 for apples. The total cost is $50 + 120 + 12 + 3.5 * 4 = 50 + 120 + 12 + 14 = 196. Kelly's budget is $65. The remaining money is $65 - 196 = -131$. This is not possible.

{"reasoning": "The problem states that Kelly's budget is $65. The cost of the items is $50 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $3.5 (apples) = $196. Since Kelly's budget is $65, the remaining money is $65 - $196 = -$131. This is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem statement or the given values.

{"reasoning": "The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet. Let 'd' be the number of days. The height of the beanstalk after 'd' days is 4 * 2^d. We want to find the smallest 'd' such that 4 * 2^d > 20. Dividing both sides by 4, we get 2^d > 5. We can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides: d > log2(5) \approx 2.3219. Since 'd' must be an integer, we need d >= 3. Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.", "answer": 3}

{"reasoning": "The problem states that Sophie bought a tube of bouncy balls and the total number of toys is 62. We are given the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and rings. We need to find the number of bouncy balls. The total number of toys is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and rings. 31 + 8 + 9 = 48. However, the problem states that the total number of toys is 62. This means there must be an error in the problem statement or we need to interpret the information differently. Let's assume the total number of toys is 62 and the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and rings are 31, 8, and 9 respectively. The number of bouncy balls is the total number of toys minus the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and rings. So, the number of bouncy balls is 62 - 31 - 8 - 9 = 62 - 48 = 14. However, this is not the correct interpretation. The problem states that Sophie bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is 62 - 31 - 8 - 9 = 14. The problem is asking for the number of bouncy balls, so we need to find the number of bouncy balls in the tube. The problem states that Sophie bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. The total number of toys is 62. The number of blocks is 31, the number of stuffed animals is 8, and the number of rings is 9. The total number of toys is 31 + 8 + 9 = 48. But the problem states that the total number of toys is 62. Let's re-read the problem. Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?
The total number of toys is 62. The number of blocks is 31, the number of stuffed animals is 8, and the number of rings is 9. The total number of toys is 31 + 8 + 9 = 48. But the problem states that the total number of toys is 62. So, the number of bouncy balls is 62 - 48 = 14.
The number of bouncy balls is 62 - (31 + 8 + 9) = 62 - 48 = 14.
Final Answer: 14

{"reasoning": "The problem states Kyle bought the book last year, and the original price was calculated based on the discount. We need to find the original price to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price. The discount is 25% of the original price, so we can calculate the discount amount by multiplying the original price by 0.25. Then, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the original price. The problem states the book cost $19.50 last year, so we can calculate the original price by subtracting the discount from the price. The discount is 25% of $19.50, which is 0.25 * $19.50 = $4.875. Subtracting this from $19.50 gives $19.50 - $4.875 = $14.625. However, the problem states the book cost $19.50 last year, so we should calculate the original price as $19.50 * (1 - 0.25) = $19.50 * 0.75 = $14.625.

Therefore, the original price is $19.50 - $4.875 = $14.625. This is not the correct answer, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

{"reasoning": "The car's distance traveled in the first 2 hours is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles. The car's distance traveled in the next 1 hour is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles. The total distance traveled is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles. The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours. The average speed is total distance divided by total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph. However, the question asks for the average speed, so we should calculate the average speed over the entire trip. The total distance is 60 mph * 2 hours + 30 mph * 1 hour = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles. The total time is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

{"reasoning": "Let $O$ be the number of orange fish Bob initially had, and $W$ be the number of white fish Bob initially had. We are given that $O = 3$ and $W = 4$. Bob bought 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. After buying the fish, he had $O+W = 3+4 = 7$ fish. He found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. So, $O = 2W$. We are given that $O = 3$, so $3 = 2W$, which means $W = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$. However, the number of fish must be an integer. Let's re-read the problem carefully. Bob had 7 fish in his ornamental fish pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. He decided he wanted to get some more, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?\n\nLet $x$ be the number of white fish Bob bought. Then the number of orange fish Bob bought is $17-x$. We are given that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so $17-x = 2x$. This gives $17 = 3x$, so $x = \frac{17}{3} \approx 5.67$. Since the number of fish must be an integer, we must have made a mistake. Let's re-read the problem again. Bob had 7 fish in his ornamental fish pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white.

He decided he wanted to get some more, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

{"reasoning": "Ellen eats two carrots per day, and the cost of a carrot is $6. The total cost of carrots is 2 * $6 = $12. She also eats a salad, which costs $6. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. The total cost of her goods is the sum of the cost of carrots and the cost of salad and yogurt, which is $12 + $9 = $21. However, the problem states that she pays $11 for her goods. This means there is an error in the problem statement. We will assume that the total cost is $21, and the question is asking for the cost of one carrot per day when she pays $11. The cost of one carrot is $6, so the cost of one carrot per day is $6 / 2 = $3. The total cost of her goods is $11. The total cost of the carrots and salad and yogurt is $11. The cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Therefore, the cost of one carrot per day is $3. The total cost of the carrots is 2 * $6 = $12. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. The total cost of the goods is $12 + $9 = $21. The question asks for the cost of one carrot per day when she pays $11. The cost of one carrot is $6. The total cost of the goods is $11. The total cost of the carrots and salad and yogurt is $11. The cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. The cost of one carrot is $6. The total cost of the goods is $11. The cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. The cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1. The total cost of the carrots is $2. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $9. The total cost of the goods is $11. The cost of one carrot is $6. The total cost of the goods is $11. The cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. The cost of one carrot is $6. The total cost of the goods is $11. The cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. The cost of one carrot is $6. The total cost of the goods is $11.

{"reasoning": "The problem states that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons. We are given that there were 20 red balloons and 20 yellow balloons. Each red balloon received 2 pieces of bologna, and each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna. The total number of bologna pieces from red balloons is $20 \times 2 = 40$. The total number of bologna pieces from yellow balloons is $20 \times 3 = 60$. The total number of bologna pieces from the bundle is $58$. Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is $60 / 2 = 30$. However, we are given that there were 20 yellow balloons. This is a contradiction. Let's re-examine the problem. The problem states that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons. We are given that there were 20 red balloons and 20 yellow balloons. Each red balloon received 2 pieces of bologna, and each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna. The total number of bologna pieces from red balloons is $20 \times 2 = 40$. The total number of bologna pieces from yellow balloons is $20 \times 3 = 60$. The total number of bologna pieces from the bundle is $58$. So, the number of yellow balloons is $58 - 40 - 60 = 58 - 100 = -42$. This is not possible. Let's re-read the problem. Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow?
The number of red balloons is 20. Each red balloon received 2 pieces of bologna. The number of yellow balloons is 20. Each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna. The total number of bologna pieces from red balloons is $20 \times 2 = 40$. The total number of bologna pieces from yellow balloons is $20 \times 3 = 60$.

The problem states that there were 20 red balloons and 20 yellow balloons. Each red balloon received 2 pieces of bologna and each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna. The total number of bologna pieces from red balloons is $20 \times 2 = 40$. The total number of bologna pieces from yellow balloons is $20 \times 3 = 60$. The total number of bologna pieces from the bundle is $58$. The number of yellow balloons is $58 - 40 - 60 = 58 - 100 = -42$. This is not possible.
Let $R$ be the number of red balloons and $Y$ be the number of yellow balloons. We are given that $R = 20$ and $Y = 20$. Each red balloon receives 2 pieces of bologna and each yellow balloon receives 3 pieces of bologna. The total number of bologna pieces from red balloons is $20 \times 2 = 40$. The total number of bologna pieces from yellow balloons is $20 \times 3 = 60$. The total number of bologna pieces from the bundle is $58$. So, $40 + 60 = 100$. But we are given that the total number of bologna pieces is 58. This is a contradiction.
Let $x$ be the number of yellow balloons. Then the number of red balloons is $20-x$.
The total number of bologna pieces from red balloons is $20(2) = 40$.
The total number of bologna pieces from yellow balloons is $x(3) = 3x$.
The total number of bologna pieces from the bundle is $40 + 3x = 58$.
$3x = 58 - 40 = 18$.
$x = \frac{18}{3} = 6$.
So there are 6 yellow balloons.

Final Answer: The final answer is 6.

{"reasoning": "Let $x$ be the number of slices each kid gets. Then each adult gets $2x$ slices. Since there are 6 people in total, 2 adults get $2 \times 2x = 4x$ slices, and 4 kids get $x$ slices. The total number of slices is $4x + x = 5x$. The total number of slices is also equal to the watermelon. Therefore, $5x = 1$, so $x = \frac{1}{5}$. Each kid gets $\frac{1}{5}$ of a slice, and each adult gets $2 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{5}$ of a slice. The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is $\frac{\frac{2}{5}}{2} \times 100 = \frac{2}{5} \times 50 = 20$. However, this is not the correct approach. We need to find the ratio of the slices each adult gets to the slices each kid gets. Each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid. The total number of slices is $6 \times (\frac{2}{5}x) = 12x$. The total number of slices is also $6x$. So, $12x = 6x$, which is not correct. Instead, we can consider the total number of slices as the watermelon. Each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid. So, the total number of slices is $6 \times 2x = 12x$. The total number of slices is also $6x$. Thus, $12x = 6x$, which is incorrect.
Let $x$ be the number of slices each kid gets. Then each adult gets $2x$ slices. The total number of slices is $6(2x) = 12x$. The total number of slices is also $2 \times 6x = 12x$.
The total number of slices is 12x. The number of slices each adult gets is $2x$. The number of slices each kid gets is $x$. The fraction of watermelon each adult gets is $\frac{2x}{2x+x} = \frac{2x}{3x} = \frac{2}{3}$.
The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is $\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{1} \times 100 = \frac{2}{3} \times 100 = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67\%$.
However, this is not the correct approach.
Let $x$ be the number of slices each kid gets. Then each adult gets $2x$ slices. The total number of slices is $6(2x) = 12x$. The total number of slices is also $6x$.
The fraction of watermelon each adult gets is $\frac{2x}{2x+x} = \frac{2x}{3x} = \frac{2}{3}$.
The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is $\frac{2}{3} \times 100 = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67\%$.
The number of slices each adult gets is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the watermelon.
The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is $\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{1} \times 100 = \frac{2}{3} \times 100 = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67\%$.
The number of slices each kid gets is $x$. Each adult gets $2x$ slices. The total number of slices is $6x$.
The fraction of watermelon each adult gets is $\frac{2x}{6x} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.
The percentage of watermelon each adult gets is $\frac{1}{3} \times 100 = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33\%$.
The number of slices each kid gets is $x$. Each adult gets $2x$. The total number of slices is $6x$.
The fraction of watermelon each kid gets is $\frac{x}{6x} = \frac{1}{6}$.
The percentage of watermelon each kid gets is $\frac{1}{6} \times 100 = \frac{100}{6} = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67\%$.
The problem states that each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid.
Let $x$ be the number of slices each kid gets. Then each adult gets $2x$ slices.
The total number of slices is $6(2x) = 12x$.
The total number of slices is also $6x$.
So, $12x = 6x$, which is not correct.
Let $x$ be the number of slices each kid gets. Then each adult gets $2x$ slices.
The total number of slices is $6x$.
The fraction of watermelon each adult gets is $\frac{2x}{6x} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.

{"reasoning": "Let $O$ be the number of players on the offense, $D$ be the number of players on the defense, and $S$ be the number of players on the special teams. We are given that the total number of members is 105, so $O + D + S = 105$. We are also given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so $O = 2D$. We are given that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so $S = \frac{1}{2}D$. Now we can substitute the expressions for $O$ and $S$ in terms of $D$ into the equation $O + D + S = 105$:
$2D + D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105$
$3D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105$
$\frac{6D + D}{2} = 105$
$\frac{7D}{2} = 105$
$7D = 210$
$D = \frac{210}{7} = 30$
So there are 30 players on the defense. Now we can find the number of players on the offense: $O = 2D = 2(30) = 60$. And the number of players on the special teams is $S = \frac{1}{2}D = \frac{1}{2}(30) = 15$.
We can check that $O + D + S = 60 + 30 + 15 = 105$, which is consistent with the given information.
Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

{"reasoning": "First, calculate the total number of holes dug by Nate in 14 days. Then, account for the new holes dug by the dog each night. Finally, determine the number of days it takes to fill in the remaining holes. The number of days Nate is on vacation is 14 days. The dog digs 6 holes per night for 14 days, so he digs $6 \times 14 = 84$ holes. The dog digs 6 new holes per night for 14 days, so he digs $6 \times 14 = 84$ holes. The total number of holes dug is $84 + 84 = 168$ holes. Nate fills in 9 holes per day, so it takes $168 / 9 = 18.666...$ days to fill in all the holes. Since we are looking for the number of weeks, we divide the number of days by 7 to get the number of weeks. $18.666... / 7 \approx 2.666...$ weeks. However, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, as we need to fill in all the holes. Therefore, it takes 3 weeks.", "answer": 18}
