Donny can drink the water in his water bottle if the temperature is at least 40 degrees. He pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce of water from the $x$-degree mug into the water bottle. Let $V_1$ be the volume of the first mug and $V_2$ be the volume of the second mug. The total volume of water in the bottle is $4+1=5$ ounces. The temperature of the mixture in the bottle is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs, where the weights are the volumes of water from each mug. So, the temperature of the mixture is $\frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot x}{4+1} = \frac{132 + x}{5}$. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we have the inequality:
$\frac{132 + x}{5} \geq 40$
$132 + x \geq 200$
$x \geq 200 - 132$
$x \geq 68$
Thus, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.", "answer": 68} - Fixing

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000$ steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Let $M$ be the amount Tasha made from mowing lawns.
We are given that $L + M = 80$.
Let $x$ be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn $3x$ times.
The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn $5x$ times.
Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so the amount she made from Joe's lawn is $6.
Since Joe paid $6, we have $x$ as the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, and the amount she made from Joe's lawn is $6.
We are not given the price per mowing, but we know that Joe paid $6 for his lawn.
Let $p$ be the price per mowing. Then $xp = 6$.
We are given that she mowed Joe's lawn $x$ times, Kamala's lawn $3x$ times, and Alba's lawn $5x$ times.
The total number of times she mowed lawns is $x + 3x + 5x = 9x$.
The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $M = 9xp$.
Since $xp = 6$, we have $M = 9(6) = 54$.
We know that $L + M = 80$, so $L + 54 = 80$.
Therefore, $L = 80 - 54 = 26$.
The amount she made from lemonade sales is $26.

Now, let's re-examine the problem.
Let $x$ be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so the amount she made from Joe's lawn is $6.
We are given that she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So she mowed Kamala's lawn $3x$ times.
The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. So she mowed Alba's lawn $5x$ times.
The total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts she made from each lawn.
We know she made $6 from Joe's lawn.
Let $p_K$ be the price per mowing for Kamala's lawn, and $p_A$ be the price per mowing for Alba's lawn.
Then the amount she made from Kamala's lawn is $3x p_K$, and the amount she made from Alba's lawn is $5x p_A$.
The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $M = 6 + 3x p_K + 5x p_A$.
We are given that $L + M = 80$.
We are also given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. This means that the price per mowing for Joe's lawn is $6/x$.
However, we don't have enough information to determine the prices for Kamala's and Alba's lawns.
Let's assume that the price per mowing is the same for all lawns.
Then $p_K = p_A = p$.
The amount she made from Joe's lawn is $x p = 6$.
The amount she made from Kamala's lawn is $3x p = 3(6) = 18$.
The amount she made from Alba's lawn is $5x p = 5(6) = 30$.
The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $M = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54$.
Then $L + M = 80$, so $L + 54 = 80$, which means $L = 80 - 54 = 26$.

Since all 9 are the same height, the average is 64 inches. Then, we need to find the average height of all 10 cheerleaders. The total height of the 9 cheerleaders is 9 * 64 = 576 inches. The total height of all 10 cheerleaders is 576 + 60 = 636 inches. The average height of all 10 cheerleaders is 636 / 10 = 63.6 inches.

Now, we need to determine the height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 in the middle, and 2 on top, with the shortest girl at the very top. We are given that the shortest girl is 60 inches tall. We are not given the heights of the other cheerleaders, so we will assume that the bottom layer is made up of the tallest cheerleaders (64 inches), the middle layer is made up of the next tallest cheerleaders, and the top layer is made up of the shorter cheerleaders. However, the problem does not specify the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer. We are only given the height of the shortest cheerleader.

Since we are not given the heights of the other cheerleaders, we will assume that the height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer. We are given that the shortest girl is at the top, so her height is 60 inches. We are not given the heights of the other cheerleaders, so we will assume that the other cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256 inches.
The middle layer has 3 cheerleaders, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.
The top layer has 2 cheerleaders, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.
The very top has 1 cheerleader, so her height is 60 inches.
The total height of the pyramid is 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

However, the problem asks for the height of the pyramid, which is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders stacked on top of each other. We are given that the shortest girl is at the top, so her height is 60 inches. We are not given the heights of the other cheerleaders, so we will assume that the other cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256 inches.
The middle layer has 3 cheerleaders, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.
The top layer has 2 cheerleaders, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.
The very top has 1 cheerleader, so her height is 60 inches.
The total height of the pyramid is 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12: 636 / 12 = 53 feet.

However, this is not the correct approach. We need to consider the height of each layer.
The bottom layer is 4 cheerleaders, so the height is 4 * 64 = 256 inches.
The middle layer is 3 cheerleaders, so the height is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.
The top layer is 2 cheerleaders, so the height is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.
The top cheerleader is 60 inches.
The total height is 64 + 64 + 64 + 64 + 64 + 64 + 64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 636 inches.
636 / 12 = 53 feet.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders.
The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
The middle layer has 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
The top layer has 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.
The top cheerleader is 60 inches tall.
Total height = 4 * 64 + 3 * 64 + 2 * 64 + 60 = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.
636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet.

The percentage difference is $\frac{18}{450} = \frac{18}{450} = \frac{9}{225} = \frac{3}{75} = \frac{1}{25} = 0.04$. So the oven is off by 4%.

If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, let $x$ be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. Then the actual temperature will be $x + 0.04x = 1.04x$. We want the actual temperature to be 520, so $1.04x = 520$.
Dividing both sides by 1.04, we get $x = \frac{520}{1.04} = \frac{52000}{104} = \frac{52000}{104} = \frac{26000}{52} = \frac{13000}{26} = \frac{6500}{13} = 500$.

Alternatively, let $x$ be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature is 468 when the set temperature is 450. The percentage difference is $\frac{468-450}{450} = \frac{18}{450} = 0.04$. This means the oven temperature is 4% higher than the set temperature.

We have a system of two equations with two variables:
