Finally, we are given that Kora made 20 dishes, so $K = 20$.

We can find the number of dishes Rory makes using the equation $R = K + 20$. Substituting $K = 20$, we get $R = 20 + 20 = 40$.

Next, we can find the number of dishes Jada makes using the equation $J = 2R$. Substituting $R = 40$, we get $J = 2(40) = 80$.

The total number of dishes they all make together is $J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140$.

2025-06-28 13:55:42,501 [WARNING] Invalid JSON string: Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate earnings from mowing lawns:** Tasha made $80 total and $6 from Joe, so she earned $80 - $6 = $74 from mowing lawns.

2. **Let 'x' be the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn:** In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and in the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.  We don't know the rate she charges for mowing, but we know the total number of times she mowed lawns.

3. **Total mowing times:**  Total mowing times = Kamala's lawn + Joe's lawn + Alba's lawn = 3x + x + 5x = 9x

4. **Let 'r' be the rate per mowing:**  Tasha earned $74 from mowing 9x lawns, so 9xr = $74.

5. **We need to find the value of x:** We are not given the rate per mowing, but we know that Joe paid $6. Let's assume that the rate for mowing each lawn is the same.  Since we are looking for the amount made from lemonade sales, we can ignore the mowing information and focus on the lemonade sales.

6. **Lemonade sales:** Tasha made $80 from lemonade and $74 from mowing. Therefore, she made $80 - $74 = $6 from lemonade sales.

```json
{"reasoning": "First, we calculated Tasha's earnings from mowing lawns by subtracting Joe's payment from her total earnings. Then, we determined that the total number of lawn mowing sessions was 9x.  Since we are not given the rate per mowing, we can assume that the problem is designed to have a simple solution where the lemonade sales are calculated directly from the total earnings and mowing earnings. Finally, we subtracted the mowing earnings from the total earnings to find the lemonade sales.", "answer": 6}

2025-06-28 13:55:42,502 [WARNING] Invalid JSON string: {"reasoning": "Let $x$ be the number of 2x4 pieces and $y$ be the number of 2x8 pieces. The cost of $x$ 2x4 pieces is $4x$ and the cost of $y$ 2x8 pieces is $6y$. The total cost must be less than or equal to $24$, so $4x + 6y \le 24$. We want to maximize the number of sticks made. The number of sticks from $x$ 2x4 pieces is $200x$ and the number of sticks from $y$ 2x8 pieces is $400y$. The total number of sticks is $S = 200x + 400y$. We want to maximize $S$ subject to $4x + 6y \le 24$, $x \ge 0$, and $y \ge 0$, where $x$ and $y$ are non-negative integers.

First, let's consider the case where we only buy 2x4 pieces. We have $4x \le 24$, so $x \le 6$. If $x=6$, then $y=0$, and $S = 200(6) + 400(0) = 1200$.
Next, let's consider the case where we only buy 2x8 pieces. We have $6y \le 24$, so $y \le 4$. If $y=4$, then $x=0$, and $S = 200(0) + 400(4) = 1600$.

Now, let's consider the case where we buy a combination of 2x4 and 2x8 pieces. We want to find the integer values of $x$ and $y$ such that $4x + 6y \le 24$ and $S = 200x + 400y$ is maximized. We can rewrite the inequality as $2x + 3y \le 12$.
If $y=0$, then $2x \le 12$, so $x \le 6$. $S = 200(6) + 400(0) = 1200$.
If $x=0$, then $3y \le 12$, so $y \le 4$. $S = 200(0) + 400(4) = 1600$.
If $x=1$, then $2(1) + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 10$, and $y \le \frac{10}{3} = 3.33$. Thus, $y=3$. $S = 200(1) + 400(3) = 200 + 1200 = 1400$.
If $x=2$, then $2(2) + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 8$, and $y \le \frac{8}{3} = 2.66$. Thus, $y=2$. $S = 200(2) + 400(2) = 400 + 800 = 1200$.
If $x=3$, then $2(3) + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 6$, and $y \le 2$. $S = 200(3) + 400(2) = 600 + 800 = 1400$.
If $x=4$, then $2(4) + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 4$, and $y \le \frac{4}{3} = 1.33$. Thus, $y=1$. $S = 200(4) + 400(1) = 800 + 400 = 1200$.
If $x=5$, then $2(5) + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 2$, and $y \le \frac{2}{3} = 0.66$. Thus, $y=0$. $S = 200(5) + 400(0) = 1000$.
If $x=6$, then $2(6) + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 0$, and $y=0$. $S = 200(6) + 400(0) = 1200$.

Comparing the values of $S$, we have $1600, 1400, 1200, 1400, 1200, 1000, 1200$. The maximum value is $1600$.

The most popsicle sticks he can make is 1600.

We are given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so $t = r + 7$. We are also given that their combined ages are 44, so $t + r = 44$. Substituting $t = r + 7$ into the second equation, we get $(r + 7) + r = 44$. This simplifies to $2r + 7 = 44$. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get $2r = 37$. Dividing by 2, we get $r = 18.5$. Then $t = r + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5$. Since ages are usually given in whole numbers, let's re-examine the problem. The problem states that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let $t_1, t_2$ be the ages of the twins and $r_1, r_2, r_3$ be the ages of the triplets. We are given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Without loss of generality, let $t_1 = r_1 + 7$. We are also given that the combined ages are 44, so $t_1 + t_2 + r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 44$. Since $t_1 = r_1 + 7$, we have $(r_1 + 7) + t_2 + r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 44$. This simplifies to $2r_1 + t_2 + r_2 + r_3 = 37$. However, we are asked to find the age of one of the twins, which is $t_1$. We are given that $t_1 = r_1 + 7$. We are also given that the combined ages are 44. Let's assume that the twins are the same age, so $t_1 = t_2$. Then $t_1 + t_1 + r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 44$, so $2t_1 + r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 44$. Since $t_1 = r_1 + 7$, we have $r_1 = t_1 - 7$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $2t_1 + (t_1 - 7) + r_2 + r_3 = 44$, so $3t_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 51$. We don't have enough information to solve for $t_1$. Let's assume that the twins are of different ages. Let $t_1$ and $t_2$ be the ages of the twins, and $r_1, r_2, r_3$ be the ages of the triplets. We are given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let $t_1 = r_1 + 7$. We are also given that $t_1 + t_2 + r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 44$. We want to find $t_1$.
Let's assume the triplets are all the same age, so $r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = r$. Then $t_1 = r + 7$ and $t_1 + t_2 + 3r = 44$. We also know that $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the ages of the twins.
If we assume $t_1 = t_2$, then $2t_1 + 3r = 44$. Since $t_1 = r + 7$, we have $2(r+7) + 3r = 44$, so $2r + 14 + 3r = 44$, which gives $5r = 30$, so $r = 6$. Then $t_1 = r + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13$.
If we assume $t_1 \neq t_2$, we can't solve for $t_1$ uniquely. However, the problem asks for the age of one of the twins, so we can assume $t_1 = t_2$.
Therefore, the age of one of the twins is 13.

Let's verify: $t_1 = 13$, $r_1 = 6$. Then $t_1 = r_1 + 7$, so $13 = 6 + 7$, which is true. The combined ages are $13 + 13 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 26 + 18 = 44$.

So the actual temperature is 4% higher than the set temperature.
We want to find the temperature Maggie should set it to if the recipe calls for 520 degrees. Let $t$ be the temperature she sets it to. We want the actual temperature to be 520, which is 4% higher than $t$. So, $t + 0.04t = 520$, which means $1.04t = 520$. Therefore, $t = \frac{520}{1.04} = \frac{52000}{104} = \frac{52000 \div 8}{104 \div 8} = \frac{6500}{13} = 500$.
Alternatively, we can set up the equation $450 + 0.04(450) = 450 + 18 = 468$, which is correct.
We want to find $t$ such that $t + 0.04t = 520$. So $1.04t = 520$, which gives $t = \frac{520}{1.04} = \frac{52000}{104} = 500$.
Another way to solve this is to find the percentage increase needed to go from 450 to 520. The increase is $520 - 450 = 70$. The percentage increase is $\frac{70}{450} \times 100 = \frac{70}{4.5} = \frac{140}{9} \approx 15.56\%$. Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to increase the setting by $15.56\%$. So the new setting is $450 + 0.1556(450) = 450 + 69.96 = 519.96 \approx 520$. However, we are told that the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe. So we need to find the temperature $t$ such that $t \times (1 + 0.04) = 520$. Thus $1.04t = 520$, so $t = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500$.

The total watermelon is divided into (x + 2x) = 3x.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids.
So, the total amount of watermelon distributed is (2 * 2x) + (4 * x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since the total watermelon is 3x, and the distributed amount is 8x, this means the watermelon is over-divided. However, the problem states that the watermelon is divided, so we must assume that the watermelon is divided equally among the family members.

Let the total watermelon be 1 (representing 100%).
Each kid gets x, so 4 kids get 4x.
Each adult gets 2x, so 2 adults get 4x.
Total watermelon distributed: 4x + 4x = 8x.
This means 8x = 1, so x = 1/8.

Each kid gets 1/8 of the watermelon.
Each adult gets 2x = 2 * (1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4 of the watermelon.

To express this as a percentage, (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

  "reasoning": "Let's calculate the total cost of the damage to Ron's car, the fine for unauthorized maintenance, and the cost of the asphalt. The damage to the car is $450. The fine is $120. The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 per bucket is 3 * $25 = $75. The total cost of fixing the pothole is $450 + $120 + $75 = $645. Ron doesn't fix the pothole, so the damage to his car is $450. The question asks how much money Ron saves by *not* fixing the pothole. Therefore, the amount saved is $450. However, the question asks how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, so we need to calculate the cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of not fixing it. The cost of fixing the pothole is $450 (damage) + $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $645. The cost of not fixing it is $450 (damage). The savings is $645 - $450 = $195. But the question asks how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. This is a bit of a trick question. Ron saves money by not fixing the pothole. The cost of fixing the pothole is $645. The damage to his car is $450. So the savings is $450 - $645 = -$195. This means Ron loses $195 by fixing the pothole. However, the question asks how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. Since he is incurring a loss, he saves -$195. But the question implies a positive savings. Let's rephrase the question: How much does Ron spend to fix the pothole? The cost is $450 (damage) + $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $645. The question asks how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. Since he spends $645 to fix it, and the damage would have been $450, he saves $450 - $645 = -$195. This means he loses $195. The question is asking how much Ron saves by fixing the pothole. Since fixing the pothole costs $645 and the damage would have been $450, Ron saves $450 - $645 = -$195. This means Ron loses $195. The question is asking how much Ron saves by *not* fixing the pothole. The cost of not fixing is $450. The cost of fixing is $645. The savings is $450 - $645 = -$195. So Ron loses $195. Let's interpret the question as: What is the difference between the cost of fixing the pothole and the damage it would cause if left unfixed? The cost of fixing is $645. The damage is $450. The difference is $645 - $450 = $195. So Ron saves $195.

We are given that the total number of players is 105, so $o + d + s = 105$. We are also given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so $o = 2d$. Furthermore, there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so $s = \frac{1}{2}d$. Substituting these expressions for $o$ and $s$ into the equation $o + d + s = 105$, we get $2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105$. Combining the terms with $d$, we have $3d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105$, which simplifies to $\frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105$, so $\frac{7}{2}d = 105$. Multiplying both sides by $\frac{2}{7}$, we get $d = 105 \cdot \frac{2}{7} = 15 \cdot 2 = 30$. Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense. We can check our answer: $o = 2d = 2(30) = 60$, and $s = \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{1}{2}(30) = 15$. Then $o + d + s = 60 + 30 + 15 = 105$, which is the total number of players.","answer": 30} - Fixing

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
She used 220 Post-it notes at the coffee shop.
She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.
So, the equation is: $80 + x - 220 = 23$.
Simplifying the equation, we get: $x - 140 = 23$.
Adding 140 to both sides, we get: $x = 23 + 140 = 163$.
Therefore, Candice purchased 163 Post-it notes.

We can check our answer:
Starting with 80, she buys 163, so she has $80 + 163 = 243$ Post-it notes.
She uses 220, so she has $243 - 220 = 23$ Post-it notes remaining.

2025-06-28 13:55:42,523 [WARNING] Invalid JSON string: Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

Let's use variables to represent the unknowns:

*   Let 'e' be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
*   Then, Ava jumps on 'e + 8' enemies.
*   Let 'b' be the number of berries Emma collects.
*   Then, Ava collects 'b + 3' berries.
*   Let 't' be the time (in seconds) Emma takes to finish the level.
*   Then, Ava takes 't + 4' seconds to finish the level.

Now, let's set up the score equations:

*   Ava's score: 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t + 4)
*   Emma's score: 10e + 5b + 30t

We want to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:

Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
Difference = [10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t + 4)] - [10e + 5b + 30t]
Difference = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t + 120 - 10e - 5b - 30t
Difference = (10e - 10e) + (5b - 5b) + (30t - 30t) + 80 + 15 + 120
Difference = 80 + 15 + 120
Difference = 215
