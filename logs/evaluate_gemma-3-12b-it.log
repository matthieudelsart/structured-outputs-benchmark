The average temperature of the water in the bottle is $\frac{132+x}{5}$. Since Donny can drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. So, $\frac{132+x}{5} \geq 40$. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $132+x \geq 200$. Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get $x \geq 200 - 132 = 68$.

Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so she mowed Joe's lawn once, which means $x=1$. Then Kamala's lawn was mowed $3x = 3(1) = 3$ times, and Alba's lawn was mowed $5x = 5(1) = 5$ times. Let $c$ be the amount Tasha earned per mowing for Kamala's lawn, $a$ be the amount Tasha earned per mowing for Alba's lawn, and $j$ be the amount Tasha earned per mowing for Joe's lawn. We are given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so $j = 6$. The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is $3c + 5a + 6$. We are given that Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let $L$ be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then $L + 3c + 5a + 6 = 80$. We are also given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so $j = 6$. Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we know that she mowed Joe's lawn once. Thus, $x=1$. The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $3c + 5a + 6$. We are given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is $6$. We are not given the amount she made per mowing for Kamala's and Alba's lawns. However, we are given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so we can assume that she mowed Joe's lawn once. Then $x=1$.

We are not given enough information to determine the values of $c$ and $a$. However, we are given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. This means that she mowed Joe's lawn once, and she was paid $6. So, the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is $6. We are given that she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn $3 \times 1 = 3$ times. We are given that she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn $5 \times 1 = 5$ times. Let $c$ be the amount she made per mowing for Kamala's lawn, and $a$ be the amount she made per mowing for Alba's lawn. The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $3c + 5a + 6$. We are given that Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let $L$ be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then $L + 3c + 5a + 6 = 80$. We are not given enough information to determine the values of $c$ and $a$. Let's assume that she made the same amount per mowing for all lawns. Let $m$ be the amount she made per mowing. Then the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $3m + 5m + 6 = 8m + 6$. So, $L + 8m + 6 = 80$, which means $L = 80 - 8m - 6 = 74 - 8m$. If $m=9$, then $L = 74 - 8(9) = 74 - 72 = 2$. If $m=8$, then $L = 74 - 8(8) = 74 - 64 = 10$. If $m=7$, then $L = 74 - 8(7) = 74 - 56 = 18$. If $m=6$, then $L = 74 - 8(6) = 74 - 48 = 26$. If $m=5$, then $L = 74 - 8(5) = 74 - 40 = 34$. If $m=4$, then $L = 74 - 8(4) = 74 - 32 = 42$. If $m=3$, then $L = 74 - 8(3) = 74 - 24 = 50$. If $m=2$, then $L = 74 - 8(2) = 74 - 16 = 58$. If $m=1$, then $L = 74 - 8(1) = 74 - 8 = 66$.

Let's assume that she made $6 per mowing. Then she mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times. The total amount she made from mowing is $6 + 3(6) + 5(6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54$. Then the amount she made from lemonade is $80 - 54 = 26$.

The cost of the wood is $4x + 6y$, and we have a budget of $24, so $4x + 6y \le 24$. We want to maximize the number of popsicle sticks, which is $200x + 400y$.

We can simplify the cost constraint by dividing by 2: $2x + 3y \le 12$.

We can consider different integer values for $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the constraint:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $x = 0$, then $3y \le 12$, so $y \le 4$. The number of sticks is $200(0) + 400(4) = 1600$.
    \item If $x = 1$, then $2 + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 10$, and $y \le 3$. The number of sticks is $200(1) + 400(3) = 200 + 1200 = 1400$.
    \item If $x = 2$, then $4 + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 8$, and $y \le 2$. The number of sticks is $200(2) + 400(2) = 400 + 800 = 1200$.
    \item If $x = 3$, then $6 + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 6$, and $y \le 2$. The number of sticks is $200(3) + 400(2) = 600 + 800 = 1400$.
    \item If $x = 4$, then $8 + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 4$, and $y \le 1$. The number of sticks is $200(4) + 400(1) = 800 + 400 = 1200$.
    \item If $x = 5$, then $10 + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 2$, and $y \le 0$. The number of sticks is $200(5) + 400(0) = 1000$.
    \item If $x = 6$, then $12 + 3y \le 12$, so $3y \le 0$, and $y = 0$. The number of sticks is $200(6) + 400(0) = 1200$.
\end{itemize}
The maximum number of popsicle sticks is 1600 when $x=0$ and $y=4$.

However, the problem asks for the cheapest lumber. A 2x4 costs $4 and a 2x8 costs $6.
If we only buy 2x4s, we can buy $24/4 = 6$ pieces, giving $6 \times 200 = 1200$ sticks.
If we only buy 2x8s, we can buy $24/6 = 4$ pieces, giving $4 \times 400 = 1600$ sticks.
So, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1600.

2025-07-02 18:56:49,355 [WARNING] Invalid JSON string: {"reasoning": "Let $x$ be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe. When she sets it to 450, the actual temperature is 468. The difference is $468 - 450 = 18$. The percentage difference is $\frac{18}{450} = \frac{1}{25} = 0.04 = 4\%$. So the oven is 4% off.

If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we want to find the temperature $x$ such that the actual temperature is 520. Since the oven is 4% off, we have $x + 0.04x = 520$, which means $1.04x = 520$.
Then $x = \frac{520}{1.04} = \frac{52000}{104} = \frac{52000}{104} = \frac{13000}{26} = \frac{6500}{13} = 500$.

Alternatively, we can say that the actual temperature is 104% of the set temperature. So, if the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we have $1.04x = 520$, where $x$ is the temperature Maggie should set the oven to.
$x = \frac{520}{1.04} = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500$.
