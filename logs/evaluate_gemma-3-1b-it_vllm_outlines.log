He grew up with a passion for music and was introduced to synthesizers in his teenage years. He moved to Rhode Island where he developed a friendship with his future bandmate Tod Ashley and Jon Spencer. In the early 1990s, he co-founded the noise rock group Cop Shoot Cop, playing sampler and keyboards. He left after their first album to form Motherhead Bug, with whom he sang and played trombone. He has also recorded and toured with Foetus and Swans. Oumiet's illustrations of creepy, bipedal, fez-capped insect creatures (usually wielding scimitars or smoking hookahs) appeared on Motherhead Bug's singles and album, and he has continued his career as an illustrator with Robert D.

He is an English drummer and former member of the rock band Mansun. He grew up in Blacon, Chester, and played in various local bands including The Wandering Quatrains and Jonti. He studied at Tech Music School in Fulham, London, and was attracted to Mansun with his playing and flamboyant look. Initially, he turned the band down due to commitments with The Wandering Quatrains and because he thought they played Britpop shite. Also, he worked as an audi car salesman at the time, later had a change of heart after the band's bass player Stove King played him a demo of their new song 'Wide Open Space'. Rathbone joined Mansun shortly before their debut album 'Attack of the Grey Lanterns' was finished. He was the third and final drummer in the band, brought in after the band had internal conflict with the previous members. Rathbone's initiation into the band was n't without mishap; arriving for his first live gig with the band, flicking through a copy of the NME for details, he found he had got the wrong train and instead of the correct destination of Brighton, he had in fact arrived at Bristol Temple Meads. Shortly after, his first proper gig with the band was a televised appearance on Channel 4 show TFI Friday, where the band performed 'Stripper Vicar'. The band released three studio albums before splitting in 2003 whilst recording their fourth. material from those session was released in 2004 as part of the 'Kleptomania' boxset. Following the breakup of Mansun, Rathbone formed Seraphim with Jonti Thackray with whom he had been in bands with prior to Mansun, and has since played with several artists including Blondie tribute band 'Into the Bleach', 'The Jokers' and 'World Upside Down'. In 2013, he performed with folk band 'Green Smoke Hokum Band' with accordion busker Russel Mabbutt and soul-funk band 'Indio's Dream', playing the percussive cajón instrument.
