2025-06-23 13:19:05,647 [WARNING] Invalid JSON string: {"reasoning": "Let T be the age of one twin and R be the age of one triplet.
There are two twins, so their combined age is 2T.
There are three triplets, so their combined age is 3R.

From the problem statement, 'One twin is 7 years older than one triplet', we can write the equation:
T = R + 7 (Equation 1)

From the problem statement, 'If their combined ages are 44', we can write the equation:
2T + 3R = 44 (Equation 2)

Now, substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
2(R + 7) + 3R = 44
2R + 14 + 3R = 44
5R + 14 = 44
5R = 44 - 14
5R = 30
R = 30 / 5
R = 6

So, one triplet is 6 years old.

Now, substitute the value of R back into Equation 1 to find T:
T = R + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

So, one twin is 13 years old.

To verify, the combined ages would be 2 * 13 + 3 * 6 = 26 + 18 = 44, which matches the given information.", "answer": 13} - Fixing
