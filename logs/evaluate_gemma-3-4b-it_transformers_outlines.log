Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. Then he pours 1 ounce of water from the second mug into his water bottle. The total amount of water in his water bottle is $4+1 = 5$ ounces. Since he is able to drink the water, the temperature must be at least 40 degrees. When he pours 4 ounces out of the 33-degree mug, the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is $33 - 4 = 29$ ounces. When he pours 1 ounce from the second mug, the remaining water in the second mug is $x - 1$ ounces. The temperature of the remaining water in the second mug is $x$ degrees. So, we have $x \"> 40$. If Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the total amount is 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixture is such that Donny can drink it, which means it is at least 40 degrees. We don't know the exact size of the mugs, but we know that 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug is 5 ounces total. Let the temperature of the second mug be $x$. Since Donny can drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces of 33 degrees and 1 ounce of $x$ degrees, the mixture must be at least 40 degrees. We can use the weighted average to solve the temperature of the mixture: $\\frac{4(33) + 1(x)}{5} \"> 40$. Therefore, $4(33) + x > 40(5)$, which simplifies to $132 + x > 200$. So $x > 200 - 132 = 68$. However, we have that $x \"> 40$. But if we consider the volume of water that is poured out with each temperature, we can assume that the volume is the same for each mug. So we can set up the equation: $\\frac{4}{33}x + \\frac{1}{x} = 40$. Multiply through by $3 - Fixing

Then Elliott finished $\\frac{x}{2}$ steps on his walks to and from school. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. So, the total number of steps he takes is 10,000. The number of steps he took to and from school is $x$, the number of steps he took with his friend is 1,000, the number of steps he took during his jog is $y$, and the number of steps left to take is 2,000. Thus, we have the equation $x + 1000 + y + 2000 = 10000$. We know that Elliott finished $\\frac{x}{2}$ steps to school, so $x/2$ is the number of steps he took during the walk to and from school. So $x$ is twice the number of steps he took during the walk to and from school. We can rewrite the equation as: \\frac{x}{2} + 1000 + y + 2000 = 10000$. We know that $\\frac{x}{2}$ is the number of steps he took to and from school. Let $s$ be the number of steps he took to and from school. Then $x = 2s$. So the equation becomes $s + 1000 + y + 2000 = 10000$, or $s + y = 10000 - 1000 - 2000 = 7000$. However, the problem asks how many steps did Elliott take during his jog. We are given that he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Thus the number of steps Elliott took to and from school is $x$.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 + 3x + 5x = 6+8x$. Additionally, let $y$ be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then we have $6+8x+y = 80$. We are not given any information about the relationship between the amount she made from lemonade sales and the number of times she mowed lawns. However, we know that the total amount she earned last month was $80, and she made $6 from Joe's lawn. Let's assume Tasha only mowed lawns. Then $8x+6=80$, so $8x = 74$, and $x = \\frac{74}{8} = 9.25$, which is not an integer. This means that Tasha made money from both lemonade and mowing lawns. Let's assume Tasha only made money from lemonade. Then $y=80$, and the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6$. However, we know she mowed lawns such that $6+8x = 80-y$, where $y$ is the amount she made from lemonade sales. Without more information, we cannot determine the exact amount she earned from lemonade sales. However, since we are asked to find how much she made from lemonade sales, we can assume that she only earned from mowing lawns, and she got $6 from Joe. Then the amount from lemonade sales is $80-6 = 74$. But this is not a reasonable answer. Let's consider the case where Tasha only mowed lawns. In this case, she earned $6 from Joe, and $3x + 5x = 8x$ from Kamala's and Alba's lawns. Thus, her total earnings are $6 + 8x = 80$, which implies $8x = 74$, so $x = \\frac{74}{8} = 9.25$. Since $x$ must be an integer, this setup doesn't work. However, the problem implies that she made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

Then, we need to calculate the total cost of Ron fixing the pothole, including the cost of the asphalt and the fine. This is $75 + $120 = $195. Finally, we need to calculate how much Ron saves by fixing the pothole, compared to the potential damage to his car. The potential damage is $450, and the cost of fixing the pothole is $195. Therefore, Ron saves $450 - $195 = $255. However, the question asks how much money Ron *saves* by fixing the pothole. Since Ron will have to pay $195 to fix the pothole, and the pothole could have caused $450 in damage, Ron saves $450 - $195 = $255. But the problem is asking how much he saves by fixing it himself as opposed to it damaging his car. Since fixing the pothole is cheaper at $195 than the potential damage would have cost $450, Ron saves $450 - $195 = $255. Let's rethink. Ron could be saving money by fixing the pothole to avoid the $450 damage. This is an alternative to allowing the damage to occur, which would cost him $450. So, he saves $450 - $195 = $255. Let's consider the other scenario: Ron lets the pothole remain unfixed, and it damages his car for $450. Then, Ron pays to fix the pothole ($195) and receives no additional money. In this case, Ron loses $450 + $195 = $645. Ron fixes the pothole and saves $450 - $195 = $255. The question asks how much money he saves by fixing the pothole. Since we are looking at the savings from the pothole, the calculation is $450 - $195 = $255. But the question states he doesn't want to pay $120 to the city for fixing the pothole, so then we should subtract that cost from the $4 - Fixing
2025-07-02 18:56:51,074 [WARNING] Invalid JSON string: {"reasoning":"Let $x$ be the number of post-it notes in the package Candice purchased. Candice started with 80 post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes at work, and she had 23 post-it notes remaining. So, the number of post-it notes she had initially minus the number of post-it notes she used minus the number of post-it notes remaining equals the number of post-it notes she purchased. Thus, $80 - 220 - 23 = x$. This is incorrect since $80 - 220 = -140$, so $-140 - 23 = -163$. Thus $x = -163$, which doesn't make sense. We should be adding the number of post-it notes she purchased to the remainder. The equation should be $80 + x - 220 - 23 = 0$, or $x - 143 = 0$, so $x=143$. Alternatively, the number of post-it notes she had after purchasing the package is $80 + x$. After using 220 post-it notes, she has $80 + x - 220 = x - 140$ post-it notes remaining. She has 23 post-it notes remaining, so $x - 140 = 23$, therefore $x = 163$. Another way is to say that the number of post-it notes she started with is equal to the number she has after purchasing the new package plus the number she has remaining. So $80 = (80+x) - 220 + 23$. This means $80 = 80 + x - 220 + 23$, so $0 = x - 220 + 23$, or $0 = x - 197$, so $x=197$. However, the equation to use is that the number of post-it notes Candice started with plus the number in the package minus the number she used equals the number she has remaining. So $80 + x - 220 = 23$. This gives $x - 140 = 23$, so $x = 163$.","answer":163 - Fixing
