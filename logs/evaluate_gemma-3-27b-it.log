Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the first mug and 1 ounce of water from the second mug into his water bottle. The resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees. We can assume that the temperature of the mixture is a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. Let $T_m$ be the temperature of the mixture. Then, we have:\n\n$T_m = \frac{4 \times T_1 + 1 \times T_2}{4 + 1} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T_2}{5} = \frac{132 + T_2}{5}$\n\nSince Donny can drink the water, $T_m \ge 40$.

Next, we need to find out how many pizzas the football team ordered. They ordered twice as many as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, so they ate 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas. This means there are 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left from the football team's order.

Finally, we need to find the total number of pizzas left. The glee club has 6 pizzas left and the football team has 8 pizzas left, so there are 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left in total.", "answer": 14} - Fixing

We have $4 \cdot 2^n > 20$. Dividing both sides by 4, we get $2^n > 5$.
We can test values of $n$:
- If $n=1$, $2^1 = 2$, which is not greater than 5.
- If $n=2$, $2^2 = 4$, which is not greater than 5.
- If $n=3$, $2^3 = 8$, which is greater than 5.

Then, we find the number of outdoor plants. This is two-thirds of the remaining plants, which is (2/3) * 75 = 50.
Finally, we find the number of flowering plants. This is the number of remaining plants minus the number of outdoor plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25.
To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.", "answer": 25} - Fixing

So, Kelly's total distance is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards. Blake is the winner. The difference between their distances is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.
