You are given **one lead paragraph from an English Wikipedia biography.** Your task is to convert that prose into a *single JSON object* that contains the main information about that biography.

### 1 · Output format

* **Return only raw JSON** — no markdown fences, no comments, no extra keys.

### 2 · Key rules

1. **Exactly the keys shown in the block below** — no more, no less, no re-ordering needed.
2. All keys are mandatory, if the paragraph does **not** contain reliable evidence for a field, keep the value as the empty string `""`.

### 3 · Template

Your answer should have the following format, fill in the values you can justify from the paragraph. Leave the others `""`.

"""
{
    'article_title': ...,
    'other_key': ...}
"""

For this specific article, I expect you to use the following keys: `{{EXPECTED_KEYS}}`.
