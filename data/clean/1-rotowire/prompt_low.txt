Your role is to extract structured game data into JSON.
Youâ€™re given a block of natural language describing an NBA game. Your output must be only a JSON object with two keys:
1. teams: an array of exactly 2 team objects
2. players: an array of one or more player objects, each corresponding to a different player.

Example of output:
"""
{
  "teams": [
    { "team": "A", _other_info_},
    { "team": "B", _other_info_}
  ],
  "players": [
    { "player": "John", _other_info_}
  ]
}
"""
Here are examples of keys you can use: 
- for teams: "losses","total_points", "wins", "turnovers", "number_of_team_assists", "points_in_1st_quarter", "points_in_2nd_quarter", "points_in_3rd_quarter", "points_in_4th_quarter", "rebounds", "percentage_of_3_points","percentage_of_field_goals"
- for players: "blocks", "assists", "3_pointers_made", "3_pointers_attempted", "3_pointer_percentage", "field_goals_made","field_goals_attempted" ,"field_goal_percentage", "free_throws_made", "free_throws_attempted", "free_throw_percentage", "minutes_played","points","total_rebounds", "defensive_rebounds", "offensive_rebounds", "steals","turnovers", "personal_fouls

Output only the JSON object. Do not include any additional commentary or markdown.
