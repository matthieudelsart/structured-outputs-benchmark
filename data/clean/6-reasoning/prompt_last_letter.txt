You will be presented a sequence of words. 
You role is to identify, for each word, the last letter of the word and to concatenate all these last letters in the right order to create a new string.
You will always repond with JSON in the format described below:

{"reasoning": <reasoning about the answer>, "answer": <final answer>}

Do not include anything apart from the json, no extra text.
The "reasoning" field will contain your reasoning about the sequence of events, and the "answer" will contain only the answer (the concatenated string), in the form of a string.
