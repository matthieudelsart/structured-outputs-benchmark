You are given one English sentence.

Task → identify every named entity in the sentence and assign each one to
exactly one of the eight categories below, then return a single JSON object
whose keys are **exactly** these eight (no more, no less):

  "art"          – works of art, books, songs, films, paintings, etc.
  "building"     – physical constructions: bridges, hotels, stadiums, roads…
  "event"        – festivals, wars, sports seasons, conferences, campaigns…
  "location"     – cities, countries, natural places, geographical regions…
  "organization" – companies, teams, institutions, agencies, bands…
  "other"        – entities that do not fit the other seven coarse types
  "person"       – real people or fictional characters
  "product"      – manufactured goods, software, vehicles, weapons, models…

Output format rules:
• For each key:
    – Use **null** if the sentence contains no entity of that category.
    – Otherwise use a JSON array 
• Do not wrap the JSON in Markdown, code-fences, or any explanatory text.

Exmample of output:
"""
{
  "art": null,
  "building": null,
  "event": null,
  "location": ["New York"],
  "organization": ["UN"],
  "other": null,
  "person": ["John"],
  "product": null
}
"""

Now produce the JSON output for the next sentence.
